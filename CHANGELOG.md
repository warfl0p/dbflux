# Changelog

All notable changes to DBFlux will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* **Schema-first table completion** — On connections with schemas (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Redshift, DuckDB), the SQL editor completes a table reference in two steps. After `FROM` or `JOIN`, typing `ra` offers the schema `raw` instead of every `raw.` table, and typing `.` after it lists that schema's tables. When the editor has a schema selected, its tables are also offered without a prefix, next to the schema names. Connections without schemas still list table names directly.
* **Show all databases per connection** — A Show all databases checkbox next to the Database field of the connection manager decides whether the sidebar lists every database on the server or only the one in the field. It is on by default, so existing connections keep listing every database. See Browsing the Schema.
* **Compact and Simple sidebar layouts per connection** — The connection manager's Main tab has a Navigator view choice for databases with schemas. Compact hides intermediate folders: the databases sit directly under the connection, and each schema lists its tables, views, routines and data types directly, while the instance views are grouped under one Instance folder. Simple shows only the databases, their schemas and each schema's tables and views, as DBeaver's simple view does. Advanced, the default, keeps the Tables and Views folders and the schema's types, indexes, foreign keys and routines. See Browsing the Schema.
* **SQL highlighting tells schemas, columns and aliases apart** — The SQL editor colors schema names, column names, table aliases and column aliases with roles of their own, in both themes. Keywords and functions are bold, and table and column aliases are italic.
* **Run the statement under the cursor** — `Ctrl+Enter` without a selection now runs only the statement under the cursor when the editor holds several `;`-separated statements, as in DBeaver. A cursor after a statement's `;` or in the blank lines below it runs that statement. Before, the whole buffer ran, after a confirmation, and running one statement needed a selection. To run every statement, select all (`Ctrl+A`) and press `Ctrl+Enter`. A buffer with a compound block, such as a procedure's `BEGIN ... END` body, still runs whole, so a statement inside the body never runs on its own. See Running Queries.
* **Fuzzy SQL completion** — The SQL editor's completion also offers tables, views, columns and keywords that contain the typed letters in order, not only those that start with them, so `messa` offers `alarm_message`. Fuzzy matches start once three characters are typed and are limited to the 50 best. Names that start with the typed text stay first and are not limited, and the matched letters are highlighted in the menu.
* **Toast timeout and a bounded notification stack** — Settings → General → Notifications sets how long a toast stays. Success and Info toasts close after it and Warning toasts after twice it, while an Error toast, and a toast with an action button or a progress bar, stays until it is dismissed; *Keep until dismissed* turns automatic closing off for every toast. Pointing at a toast holds its timer, which resumes when the pointer leaves. Toasts stack in the top-right corner of the document area and at most four show at once; older ones fold into an *N more* entry that expands or dismisses them together.
* **Font family and size settings** — Settings → General → Appearance can change the interface font and size, the editor font and size, and the data grid font and size. The interface size scales all interface text together with the rows, controls, icons and text fields that hold it, so larger text is not clipped. The editor size sets the editor line height, and the grid size sets row height, header height and automatic column widths, while columns resized by hand keep their width. The editor font also sets the monospace text in the interface, such as metadata, key hints and the console, and the grid uses the editor font unless it has its own. Families are picked from a searchable list of installed fonts. A saved font that is no longer installed stays selected in Settings: the interface and editor fonts fall back to the bundled fonts, and the grid falls back to the editor font. Sizes go from 8 to 32 px, and changes apply to every open window when saved, without a restart. See Settings.
* **Brazilian Portuguese interface** — DBFlux can be used in Brazilian Portuguese. It is picked automatically when the system language is Portuguese, and Language in Settings → General lists it as Português (Brasil). Anything not yet translated shows in English.
* **External scripts folders** — The Scripts view can list scripts from folders outside DBFlux's own scripts folder, such as a repository of SQL files shared across projects, without copying them. Add one with Add external folder in the Scripts view's + menu or Add external scripts folder… in the command palette. Scripts open and save in place, and creating, renaming, moving and deleting inside the folder work as in DBFlux's own folder. Press R on the folder to pick up changes made outside DBFlux; a folder that is moved or unmounted stays listed as unavailable, and Remove from sidebar forgets it without touching its files. See Browsing the Schema.
* **Native console** — PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite, Redshift, ClickHouse, Turso, MongoDB and Redis offer a console that runs one native command at a time and prints the result as text. It is docked under tables, document collections and the key-value browser (Ctrl+` shows or hides it), and Open console in a database's sidebar menu opens one in its own tab. Commands go through the editor's validation and dangerous-query confirmation, are recorded in the audit log, join the query history (Up and Down walk it) and complete like the editor. Drivers that enforce a row limit apply the editor row limit to console commands. See the new Console page of the documentation.
* **MCP `connect` reports the database context** — The `connect` tool now returns `current_database`, the database the session is on, and `databases`, the names of the databases available on the server. An AI client whose connection lands on a default or maintenance database can see that at once and pass `database` to the other tools, instead of querying a table that lives elsewhere and getting a "does not exist" error. Drivers without databases omit both fields.
* **MCP `list_tables` and `list_collections` can return names only** — Both tools accept `names_only: true` and then return `tables` as a list of name strings instead of one object per table, view or collection. An AI client that only needs the names gets a much smaller response on a database with many tables. Without the parameter the response is unchanged.
* **MCP read tools suggest names for tables and columns that are not listed** — When the driver fails a `select_data`, `count_records`, `aggregate_data` or `describe_object` call and the table or collection is not listed in the schema metadata of the database that was queried, the error now says where the name was looked up and lists the closest names ("Did you mean: users?"). It says "not listed" rather than "does not exist", because the connection may simply not have access to the table. If the call did not pass `database` and the server lists several databases, it also says the table may be in another one. On tables, a failed `count_records` or `aggregate_data` call with a misspelled column in `where` or `order_by` gets the closest column names, with the list of available columns when the table has 20 or fewer. On SQLite and Turso, which read an unknown quoted identifier as a string and so return no rows rather than an error for a misspelled column, `select_data` checks every column it names in `columns`, `where` and `order_by` against the table's column metadata before it runs, comparing names the way SQLite does (ASCII case folding only, views and generated columns included), and refuses an unlisted one with the same hint instead of running the query. Engines that fail on an unknown column run the call and get the hint after the failure. A pseudo-column the driver declares for the table, such as SQLite's `rowid`, MySQL's `_rowid` or PostgreSQL's `ctid` and `xmin`, counts as listed. A call without `joins` whose `columns` names one runs as a generated SELECT, the way a join does, so the value is returned (PostgreSQL system columns now decode instead of showing their type name); that SELECT accepts only the `where` operators a join accepts, plain ASCII identifiers, each column once and `asc` or `desc` as the sort direction. Without `describe_object` the refusal names no other column, and the check is skipped when the driver has no column metadata for the table. The hint is built from the schema metadata the driver exposes, so drivers that do not expose it return the original error, and it only includes names the client is allowed to list (`list_tables`, `describe_object`, `list_databases`). The engine's own error text is kept at the end.
* **MCP `select_data` joins tables** — `select_data` now runs the `joins` parameter it already advertised instead of rejecting it, so an AI client can read across related tables in one call: `inner`, `left`, `right` and `full` joins, with `where`, `order_by`, `limit` and `columns` able to name a column of any joined table as `table.column` or `alias.column`. It runs on connections whose driver declares join support and renders structured SELECT queries, and is tested on SQLite. Document, key-value and other drivers that do not declare it return an explicit error. The call is still a read under the same policies: the join condition accepts only column comparisons joined by `AND`, names must be plain identifiers, values are sent as literals, the generated query runs only if it classifies as a read, and it is recorded in the audit log. With joins, `where` accepts the comparison operators, `$in`, `$like`, null tests, `$and` and `$or`, and `$ilike` on drivers that declare it. A schema-qualified table is refused on connections that drop the schema from generated queries (SQLite, Turso) instead of reading another table, and an `order_by` direction other than `asc` or `desc` is refused. SQL Server runs joins too, with its row limit rendered as `OFFSET … FETCH`; the join tests run on SQLite. A call without `joins` behaves as before, unless `columns` names a pseudo-column such as `rowid`, which runs the same generated query.
* **CSV and TSV files** — A `.csv` or `.tsv` file opens as a table, from Ctrl+O (whose dialog gains a CSV / TSV filter), recent files, the Scripts view or `dbflux <file>`, and an object of that type opens from Open in editor in the object browser, whatever its size. The delimiter, quote, header row and encoding are detected and can be changed from the toolbar. The file is read 500 records at a time (] or Load more). T switches to a text view of the same records, and Shift+T switches that view between Raw, which can be edited, and Aligned, which lines the columns up for reading. Cells, rows and column names can be edited, rows inserted and deleted, and a column added once the whole file is loaded. A save rewrites only the records that changed and copies every other byte of the file as it was, and it is refused when the file changed elsewhere since it was opened. See the new CSV and TSV Files page of the documentation.
* **Parquet files** — A `.parquet` file opens read-only as a table, from the open-file dialog (which gains a Parquet filter), recent files or the Scripts view. The rows are read 500 at a time with Load more, and before each batch DBFlux checks that the file was not changed since it was opened; if it was, no more rows are read and Reload from file opens it again. A wide file opens with its leading columns: the first always, then as many as keep one batch within 16 MiB, up to 32, and the footer says how many of the file's columns are shown. Each column header shows its type and, from the file's footer, its compression ratio, size on disk and share of nulls. Binary values show a hex preview of their first bytes, and lists, structs and maps show as JSON. A header above the table gives the file's column count, row count and size on disk. The "N of M columns" button in the toolbar (F) chooses the columns to read: tick them, search by name or type, and Apply reads the file again from its first row with them. A strip under the toolbar says what the next batch will read, in bytes and row groups, and which columns take most of it. T switches to the Columns view, one row per column with its codec, size on disk, compression ratio, share of the file, nulls and value range from the footer; its eye toggles add or drop a column at once, Shift+T cycles its sort (table order, size, name) and / filters it. The button and the Columns view always show the same columns. Rows cannot be edited or sorted. Encrypted files and files compressed with Brotli or LZO are refused with a message that names the codec. A `.parquet` object in object storage opens the same way. From S3, whose objects can be read in parts, only the bytes each batch needs are read, and the object is checked for changes before each batch. Other object stores cannot read part of an object, so DBFlux first asks whether to download the whole object, naming its size; declining closes the tab. The object is downloaded once, into memory up to 64 MiB and into a temporary file above that, which is removed when the tab closes, and every batch is read from that copy. Reload from file then checks whether the object changed: if it did not, a notice says so, and if it did, DBFlux asks again before downloading it. The header says whether the object is read by range or was downloaded whole. A local Parquet tab is open again after a restart, showing the default columns; Parquet objects are not reopened, because they need their connection.
* **More Vim commands in editors** — With Vim mode on, `o` and `O` open a line below or above the cursor with the same indentation and enter Insert mode; the new line and the text typed there undo as one step. `p` and `P` put the clipboard after or before the cursor and accept a count (`3p`). Text that Vim yanked or deleted as whole lines puts as whole lines; text copied elsewhere puts as whole lines when it ends with a line break. `Ctrl+Shift+V` pastes the clipboard: before the cursor in Normal mode, as `P` does, and at the cursor in Insert and Replace mode. `Ctrl+V` keeps its meaning. Read-only editors do not change. See Keyboard.
* **Spreadsheet files** — An `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xls` or `.ods` file opens from the open-file dialog (which gains a Spreadsheet Files filter), recent files or the Scripts view. Its sheets are tabs under the table: Alt+L and Alt+H step through them, a hidden sheet is marked, and a chart sheet is listed but cannot be opened. Columns are lettered A, B, C as in a spreadsheet and the first row is shown as data. A bar above the table shows the selected cell's formula (`=B2*2` for xlsx, OpenFormula for ods), or says it has none; `.xls` files do not expose formula text, so it says the formula is not available. A Table | Text switch (`t`) shows the sheet's values as read-only CSV, pending edits included, to select, copy and search with the editor's find; a sheet whose text would pass 8 MiB or 50,000 lines shows its first rows and says how many of the sheet's rows that is. The whole sheet is read into memory, one sheet at a time, and a sheet larger than 10,000,000 cells is refused with its size. Cells of `.xlsx`, `.xlsm` and `.ods` files can be edited, and Append row (`a a`) adds rows at the end of a sheet; rows inside a sheet cannot be inserted or deleted, so formulas and charts keep pointing at the right cells. A typed value starting with `=` is a formula (OpenFormula such as `[.B2]*2` in `.ods`), one starting with `'` is text, `true` or `false` stays a boolean in a boolean cell, a number becomes a number, and an ISO date typed into a date cell becomes a date. Edits on several sheets are kept across sheet switches, a dot marks each edited sheet, and a warning counts the formula cells a value will replace. Save (Ctrl+S) patches the file in place: only the edited sheets and the parts that must follow them are rewritten, and charts, images, comments, tables and macros are kept byte for byte. A file changed elsewhere or a cell the file cannot store is refused with the cell named, and nothing is written. Closing or quitting with unsaved edits asks first, and a small local file is saved on quit. `.xls` files stay read-only; Save as .xlsx (Ctrl+S, the read-only banner or the pane actions) first says what the new file does not keep (formulas become their values, and formatting, number formats other than dates, merged cells, column widths, charts, images and macros are dropped), then writes the values of every worksheet into a new `.xlsx` file chosen in the save dialog (on this computer, also for an object), refuses to replace the original `.xls`, and opens the new file in a tab where it can be edited. A local spreadsheet tab is restored with the session on its first sheet, without pending edits, and a file gone at startup is skipped. A spreadsheet in object storage opens from the object browser: it is read by range when the storage service supports it, and otherwise DBFlux names its size and asks before downloading it whole. Saving it uploads the patched workbook after checking that the object has not changed since it was opened, refuses the save when it has, and records the save in the audit log; quitting with unsaved edits to an object always asks first.
* **Results beside the editor** — A query tab can show its results to the right of the editor instead of below it, which suits wide screens. Switch with the panel button in the results header, the pane actions, or **Move results beside or below the editor** in the command palette; drag the divider to resize. New query tabs open with the position chosen last. `Ctrl+j` and `Ctrl+k` move between the editor and the results in either position. See Working with Results.
* **Row limit shown in the result footer, with Count rows and Load all rows** — A query result the editor row limit cut short no longer raises a "Rows omitted" warning toast and banner. Its footer reads "First 10,000 rows loaded" instead. For a single statement that only reads, **Count rows** runs it inside `SELECT COUNT(*)` without fetching the rows and the footer shows "10,000/52,310 rows loaded" (SQL connections), and **Load all rows** runs it again without the limit in the same tab. Both are also in the table menu (`m`). Scrolling to the last loaded row of such a result fetches the next rows, as many as the limit, and appends them, until the statement has no more rows. Row counts in the footer and the result tabs use thousands separators. See Settings.

### Changed

* **Active statement highlighted in the gutter only** — The statement under the cursor in the code editor is now marked only in the gutter, with its bar, fill and bold line numbers. The text area behind it keeps the editor background, so the line you are editing is no longer tinted; the cursor line shows the theme's regular active-line color.

### Fixed

* **Edits in the data grid that were not saved** — An edit that only swapped whitespace in a value, such as a space for a tab or a line break, or that only changed text past the value's 200th character, is now saved; before, it was dropped without a message. Set NULL on a cell holding the text `NULL`, and Unset field on a document field holding the text `missing`, now take effect. Committing a decimal value such as `1.0` without changing it no longer saves it again. Pasting a cell's copied value back onto the same cell no longer stages a change; before, a NULL cell was set to an empty string, and a long value, or one with Windows line breaks, could be overwritten by its copy, in which tabs and line breaks are spaces. A row whose delete is undone keeps its cell edits, so Save all saves them. Undo and redo no longer change a table that cannot be edited.
* **Quitting no longer hangs on an unreachable database** — Closing DBFlux while a connection's host could not be reached, for example after switching networks or VPNs, left the window on "Closing connections…" until the operating system gave up on the connection, about 15 minutes on Linux. Shutdown now waits at most three seconds for connections to close and then quits.
* **File pickers report a missing system file dialog** — Import Script and Add External Scripts Folder in the Scripts view, Open Script File, the SSH key, SSL certificate, SSL key and database file pickers in the connection manager, and the SSH key picker in the SSH tunnel settings now show an error when the system has no native file dialog. Before, the click did nothing.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-10-08

### Fixed

* **SQL numbers and keywords highlighted** — Numbers in the SQL editor were colored as strings, `CASE`, `WHEN`, `THEN` and `ELSE` were not colored at all, and modifier keywords such as `UNIQUE`, `CASCADE`, `RESTRICT` and `CHECK` used the type color. Numbers now use the number color, also in exponent form such as `1e3`, and those keywords the keyword color.
* **Completion after a schema name** — Typing a schema name and a dot in the SQL editor, such as `raw.`, now lists the tables and views of that schema, filtered by what follows the dot. Before, the completion menu closed, so a schema-qualified table name had to be typed by hand.
* **Document tabs past the window edge** — The tab row now scrolls sideways when more tabs are open than fit, so a tab that sits past the window edge can be reached with the mouse wheel or a trackpad. Before, those tabs were clipped and had no way to be shown.

### Security

* **Writes hidden in read queries are classified as writes** — The SQL classifier that decides whether an MCP `execute_script` call is governed as a read, and whether an editor query may auto-refresh, now classifies these statements as writes: a data-modifying CTE such as `WITH d AS (DELETE … RETURNING *) SELECT * FROM d`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` of a write, `SELECT … INTO` a new table, `OUTFILE` or `DUMPFILE`, locking reads such as `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, and a write in any later statement of a batch. Before, a statement was classified by its first keyword, so an MCP role allowed only to read could run these writes and auto-refresh could repeat them on a timer. The classifier does not detect functions with side effects.
* **Read scripts run in a read-only mode the database enforces** — An MCP `execute_script` call classified as a read or metadata now runs in a session where the database rejects data modification: `BEGIN READ ONLY` on PostgreSQL and Redshift, `START TRANSACTION READ ONLY` on MySQL and MariaDB, `PRAGMA query_only` on SQLite and `readonly = 2` on ClickHouse, rolled back or restored afterward. PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB still allow writes to temporary tables inside a read-only transaction. On drivers that cannot enforce read-only (SQL Server, Turso, external IPC drivers, Redis Cluster, DynamoDB, CloudWatch and InfluxDB), MCP now governs read scripts as writes, so a read-only role is denied there and a policy that asks for approval on writes asks. The same happens when PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB or SQLite refuse read-only enforcement because the session already has an open transaction. On MySQL and MariaDB, a read script that contains an executable comment (`/*! */`, `/*M! */`) or `INTO`, or that runs while a transaction or `LOCK TABLES` may be open, does not run read-only and is governed as a write instead. Editor auto-refresh runs with the same enforcement. It switches back to Manual when the driver cannot enforce read-only or refuses it, and when the query would need a dangerous-query confirmation, which an unattended run never asks for. It now checks the text that actually runs, the selection when there is one, instead of the whole buffer. Database-enforced read-only does not stop functions with external effects, such as PostgreSQL `dblink_exec`, `COPY … TO PROGRAM` or `pg_terminate_backend`, so least-privilege database credentials remain the boundary. MongoDB has no read-only session, so DBFlux enforces it per operation instead of the server: each operation of a script or statement is checked against a Read ceiling before it is sent, and unknown operations, aggregations with `$out`, `$merge` or `$changeStream` at any depth, and `runCommand` are refused. Redis has no read-only session either, so DBFlux checks the single command a script sends against the flags the server reports in `COMMAND INFO` before sending it: it runs only when the server marks it read-only and gives it no other risky flag, and transactions, `EVAL` and its read-only variants, `SELECT`, subscriptions, `MONITOR`, `PFCOUNT`, module commands and negative-count random-member reads are refused. Read-only mode protects data, not availability: expensive reads such as `KEYS *` still run, and DBFlux sets no Redis read timeout. See the AI and MCP integration guide.
* **MongoDB writes hidden in aggregations and single statements** — An aggregation with a `$out` or `$merge` stage at any depth, including under a computed key, is now classified as a write. A single shell statement is now checked against the authorized ceiling when read-only is requested, as scripts already were. An MCP script that the ceiling stops partway through is now reported as a tool error instead of a partial success.

### Changed

* **PostgreSQL editor queries stop at the row limit** — A query run from the editor now stops reading rows from the server once the editor row limit is reached, instead of downloading the whole result and keeping only the first rows. `SELECT * FROM` a large table returns as soon as its first page arrives. An error the query would raise in a later row is no longer reported. `CALL` and queries inside a transaction you opened with `BEGIN` still read the whole result. See the PostgreSQL driver page.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

* **Focus editor jumped to the context bar** — Ctrl+Shift+2 now takes you to the query text instead of the dropdowns above it.
* **Focus editor typed into a hidden editor** — With the results maximized, Ctrl+Shift+2, or moving up out of the results, now restores the split and shows the query text it focuses. Before, the results stayed maximized and the keys went to the hidden editor, changing the query without showing it.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

* **Values typed into a data grid cell were lost when its tab closed** — A value typed into a cell, or edited in the cell editor dialog, and not yet confirmed with Enter or Save, is now kept when its tab is closed, whether by the close button, a middle-click, the tab menu, the close-tab shortcut or closing several tabs at once. It becomes a pending change, and the unsaved-changes prompt asks whether to save or discard it; before, the tab closed and the value was dropped without a word. A JSON value that does not parse keeps the tab open with the dialog showing the error. Right-clicking a tab now confirms a value typed into a cell of the active tab, because every item of the tab menu closes tabs; clicking outside the table anywhere else still cancels it, as before.
* **Cancelling a query could cancel the next one** — Cancelling a PostgreSQL or Redshift query now sends a single cancel request, and only while a query is running on the connection; a ping or schema load holding the connection is no longer cancelled instead. Before, each cancel sent two requests, or one even when the connection was idle, and a late request could stop the next query run on the same connection. A query that finishes just as the cancel is sent can still leave a request that stops the next statement, but the window is much shorter. Cancelling a running instance inspector query still stops it.
* **Audit log showed queries from the app as run by an unknown actor** — Queries run from the editor or the console, and other actions recorded from the app without a named actor, now show the actor `local` in the audit log, as connection and settings events already did. Before, they showed `unknown (User)`, and filtering the audit log by the actor `local` left them out. Events recorded for MCP clients, hooks, scripts and the system are unchanged.
* **Audit log search did not find events by driver or database** — The audit log's search box now also matches an event's driver, database, connection id and object, so searching for `postgres` finds the queries run on PostgreSQL connections. Before, it only matched the summary, action, error message and details, and query events, whose query text is stored as a fingerprint, were not found by their driver or database. Searching by a connection's name is not supported yet.
* **Chart time axis on monthly and yearly data** — When a chart's time axis spans more than a week per tick, its ticks now fall on the first day of a month, every one, three or six months and labelled like `2025-03`, or on the first day of a year, labelled like `2025`. Before, they were placed every 30 days counted from 1970, so twelve monthly points showed ticks such as `2025-01-12` and `2025-02-11` that matched none of the points.
* **Whole numbers in chart tooltips** — The chart tooltip and the point inspector no longer pad values with zeros: a count of 21 reads `21` instead of `21.000`, zero reads `0`, and 1.5 reads `1.5`. Values keep up to three decimals.
* **Chart tooltip names the hovered point** — The tooltip that follows the pointer over a time chart now opens with the time of the point being read: a date such as `2025-03-01` for daily or monthly data, the date and time of day when a chart spanning several days has points within the day, and the time of day alone on charts shorter than a day. Before, it showed the time of day under the pointer followed by the minutes since the start of the chart, so monthly data read `00:00 UTC · t+172800m`.
* **Point inspector while hovering a chart** — While the pointer is over a chart point, the point inspector's Time now shows that point's time and its Series names the series whose value it shows. Before, Time showed the pointer's position between points, such as `2025-05-03 22:11:54`, and Series could name another series than the one the pointer was on, because it only followed the keyboard.
* **Chart Y-axis picker stays open** — Clicking a column in the Y-axis picker of a chart, in a result, a chart tab or a dashboard panel's configuration, now leaves the picker open so several columns can be checked or unchecked in a row, as Space already did from the keyboard. Before, it closed after every click.
* **Sorted set scores with decimals were not grouped by thousands** — The score column of a sorted set in the key-value browser now groups the digits of decimal scores the same way as whole ones, so 48210.5 shows as 48,210.5 next to 41,875. Before, only whole-number scores were grouped.
* **Multi-select lists ignored mouse clicks on their items** — Clicking an item in a multi-select list, such as the Category, Level and Outcome filters of the audit viewer, now toggles it and keeps the list open. Before, pressing the mouse button on an item closed the list before the click registered, so items could only be toggled with the keyboard.
* **Settings errors and hints in Settings → General** — An invalid number entered in Settings → General is now reported under its field in the Settings window, and saving moves to that field and scrolls it into view; before, the error appeared only as a notification in the main window, so nothing seemed to happen. The hints for Object preview limit and Key-value size limit now sit under their fields instead of beside them.
* **Chart point inspector called every result row a document** — The section of the chart point inspector that lists the fields of the result row behind a point is now titled Source row, instead of Source doc, so it reads correctly for tables as well as document collections. The label changed in every interface language.
* **Nix overlay packages built with the system's nixpkgs** — `pkgs.dbflux`, `pkgs.dbflux-bin`, `pkgs.dbflux-nightly` and `pkgs.dbflux-source` from `dbflux.overlays.default` are now built with the nixpkgs of the system that applies the overlay, instead of the nixpkgs pinned in DBFlux's `flake.lock`. Before, the prebuilt binary was patched against that older glibc, so on a NixOS system whose graphics drivers were built with a newer glibc, the Mesa driver failed to load and DBFlux stopped at startup with a panic in `khronos-egl`. The flake's own outputs (`nix run`, `nix profile install`, `packages.<system>.*`) are unchanged. See Install.

### Security

* **MCP script tools stay inside the scripts folder** — The MCP `get_script`, `update_script`, `delete_script`, `create_script`, `list_scripts` and `execute_script` tools now refuse a path that leads out of DBFlux's scripts folder, whether through `..`, an absolute path or a symlink that points elsewhere, and `create_script` refuses a name or extension that contains a path separator. Before, an MCP client allowed to use these tools could read, overwrite or delete files outside the scripts folder by passing a path such as `../../.ssh/config`.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-10-02

### Added

* **Application menu on macOS** — The menu bar now carries the application menu every Mac app has, instead of an app name that opened nothing: About DBFlux (opens Settings → About), Services, Hide DBFlux (Cmd+H), Hide Others (Cmd+Option+H), Show All and Quit DBFlux (Cmd+Q), followed by a Window menu that lists the open windows with Minimize, Zoom and Enter Full Screen. Quit is a command like the others — Cmd+Q on macOS, Ctrl+Q on Linux and Windows — so it is listed and rebindable in Settings → Keybindings, and it asks before quitting while a query is still running, as the window's close button does.

### Fixed

* **Linux install script** — The installation command on the website no longer stops with "Checksum verification failed!": the downloaded release now passes its checksum check, and a mismatch prints the expected and actual hashes. The release signature is now checked against the DBFlux signing key's full fingerprint, using a temporary keyring fetched over HTTPS, so it no longer needs `dirmngr` or the keyserver port and no longer writes to your own keyring. Installing from an extracted release without a terminal installs that release instead of downloading another, `--build` no longer reads its confirmation from the piped script, and `--version 0.8.5` is accepted as `v0.8.5`.
* **.deb and .rpm download links** — The `.deb` and `.rpm` commands in the installation guide and its translations returned 404, because the packages are named after their version. Releases now also publish them as `dbflux-linux-amd64.deb`, `dbflux-linux-arm64.deb`, `dbflux-linux-amd64.rpm` and `dbflux-linux-arm64.rpm`, each with a `.asc` signature and a `.sha256` checksum, so the documented `releases/latest/download/` links download the latest packages.
* **MongoDB over SSH tunnels and replica sets** — A MongoDB connection entered as fields now connects to exactly the host it names (`directConnection=true`, as Compass does). Before, the driver replaced that host with the members the server advertises, so through an SSH tunnel or proxy to a replica set whose member is named after the remote loopback (`127.0.0.1:27017`) it left the tunnel and timed out with `ReplicaSetNoPrimary`, or reached a local MongoDB on the same port.
* **MongoDB SSL mode "on"** — Connecting with SSL mode **on** no longer fails with `tlsallowinvalidhostnames is an invalid option`. The driver's rustls backend does not accept that option, and `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates` already skips the hostname check there.
* **Empty workspace in longer languages** — The start card of the empty workspace is wider, so labels such as Command palette in Spanish no longer wrap onto a second line beside their shortcut keys.
* **Window size and position survive a restart** — The main window reopens at the size and position it had when DBFlux closed, maximized again if it was maximized. A window saved on a display that is no longer connected comes back on one that is attached, and the window is fitted to the screen's usable area, so its title bar and its bottom edge stay visible. Before, each launch gave the window a default size taken from the full display instead of the work area: on a screen whose work area is shorter, the window opened as tall as the screen, with its header above the top edge and its bottom under the taskbar. The first launch of a fresh installation now fits the window to the screen the same way. On Wayland the compositor owns window placement and does not report where a window ended up, so there the position is a request rather than a restored value.
* **Instance metric time ranges** — Live instance charts now display the full selected time range instead of fitting the axis to the samples collected so far. Relative ranges advance on refresh, applied custom ranges stay fixed, and changing a dashboard's shared range immediately updates retained samples and axes even while a refetch is queued or fails. Charts explain that only the latest 120 session samples are kept in memory; refreshing or saving an editable overview does not reconstruct or persist metric history.
* **Vertical scrolling in wide tables** — The vertical scrollbar stays at the visible right edge of the table, even when more columns extend off-screen. It no longer requires scrolling horizontally to the last column before the scrollbar can be used.
* **Switching databases with an environment-variable password** — Connections whose password comes from an environment variable or an inline literal value now keep working when you switch to another database of the same profile or open a second database in its own tab. Before, the new connection silently dropped that password and tried the stored keyring one (or none), so the switch failed with an authentication error unless the password happened to also be stored. A password that comes from a secret provider or an auth profile still cannot be resolved on those paths and now fails with a clear message instead of falling back.
* **The main window is an ordinary window again** — DBFlux created its main window as a floating window, which on macOS opened it as a panel above every other window and outside the reach of AeroSpace, Mission Control, Spaces and Stage Manager, so it could not be tiled, moved between spaces or brought forward with the window manager's own keys. The main window is now an ordinary window, managed like any other application's, and switching between windows follows the layout. Linux and Windows were not affected.
* **Empty workspace card heights** — The Start and Recent cards of the empty workspace are now the same height when four recent files are listed. Before, the Recent card's rows were 2 px shorter, so the card ended 8 px above the Start card.
* **Failed schema loads in the sidebar and the audit log** — The error row under a connection whose schema or database list failed to load now shows its full message in a tooltip instead of only the part that fits the sidebar. The audit entry for a reported error now records the underlying cause and the suggested action in its details, where it used to keep only the error kind. A disconnected connection that was expanded before it closed now draws a collapsed chevron.
* **MCP filter operators visible to AI clients** — The `where` parameter of `select_data`, `count_records`, `aggregate_data`, `update_records` and `delete_records` now lists the filter operators in its description (`$eq`, `$in`, `$like`, `$exists`, `$and` and the rest), with an example. Before, the description said only that the filter is a JSON object, so a client had to guess the operator names.
* **One-row filter and builder fields stay on one line** — The WHERE filter of the data grid, the query builder fields, the document query fields and the console input no longer take a second line. Before, Enter or Shift+Enter added a line break to the field: the text scrolled up out of the single row and the field looked empty while the filter stayed applied. These fields now ignore line breaks from the keyboard and drop them from pasted text, and Enter still applies the filter or submits the command.
* **Row limits on SQL Server** — A SELECT built in the visual query builder on a SQL Server connection with a row limit or an offset now runs. Before, the builder wrote `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` as other databases expect, which SQL Server rejects as a syntax error, so the query failed and its preview showed SQL that could not be run. The builder now writes `OFFSET … ROWS FETCH NEXT … ROWS ONLY`. Opening a SQL Server table that has no primary key and whose first column is `xml`, `text`, `ntext` or `image` also works now: an unsorted page was ordered by the first column, which SQL Server cannot sort for those types, so the table failed to load. Unsorted reads no longer sort by any column, so their row order is whatever the server returns, as on other databases. Other databases generate the same SQL as before.
* **Key-value rows line up with their columns** — In the value panel of a key-value connection such as Redis, the rows of a sorted set, a list, a set, a hash and a stream now span the full width of the panel, so every cell sits under its column header. Before, each row was only as wide as its own text: in a sorted set the score was drawn right after the member name and the relative bars started at a different place on every row, and in the other views the format badge, the delete button and the row borders ended at a different place on every row.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-09-30

### Added

* **Visual query builder for document collections** — MongoDB collections gain a **Builder** button that opens a right-rail builder: filter conditions in all-of / any-of groups with operators that follow each field's type, include or exclude projection, sort, limit and skip, and a group stage with `$count`, `$sum` and `$avg` that runs as a read-only aggregation. Fields come from the collection's schema sample, the builder stays in sync with the query bar, and clauses it cannot show (such as `$expr`) are never overwritten without asking. Document drivers without a builder show the button disabled.

* **Saved document queries** — Queries built in the document builder can be named, saved per collection and reopened in the mode they were saved in.
* **Shortcuts for workspace commands** — Commands that ran only from the command palette now have shortcuts: Ctrl+, opens settings, Ctrl+Shift+E, Ctrl+Shift+R and Ctrl+Shift+T show or hide the editor, results and background tasks panels, and Ctrl+Shift+L, Ctrl+Shift+O, Ctrl+Shift+C, Ctrl+Shift+D, Ctrl+Shift+M and Ctrl+Shift+G open auth profile login, the AWS SSO wizard, a saved chart, a new dashboard, MCP approvals and a governance refresh. macOS uses Cmd instead of Ctrl. Export connections is now in the command palette.
* **Keyboard access to the notifications, sidebar views and last error** — Ctrl+Shift+B opens or closes the notifications center, Ctrl+Shift+5, Ctrl+Shift+6 and Ctrl+Shift+7 show the Connections, Scripts and Dashboards views of the sidebar, and Ctrl+Shift+X opens the most recent error in the audit viewer, as the error toast's View in Audit does. Each is also a command palette entry.
* **Keyboard-operable dropdowns** — A dropdown or multi-select that has keyboard focus now opens with Enter or Space, moves with J and K or the arrows, chooses with Enter, toggles a multi-select item with Space and closes with Escape. Choosing or closing gives focus back to the control that held it. Dropdowns driven by a keyboard ring, such as the execution context bar and the audit filters, keep their ring's keys.
* **Pane actions menu** — In the code editor, Shift+F10 opens a menu of the whole toolbar from the text, in every Vim mode and without Vim, and so do M and Shift+F10 in the execution context bar that Ctrl+K moves to. Script editors (Lua, Python, Bash) get an Actions button in their context bar, so Ctrl+K lands there as well and Enter, M or a click opens the menu. The menu lists Run or Cancel, Run in new tab, Save, Format, Query history, Explain, Chart, Refresh and the auto-refresh interval, each with its shortcut. J and K move, Enter runs the entry and Escape closes the menu. The auto-refresh entry opens the interval list with keyboard focus. The menu is also in the command palette as Open pane actions. The data table keeps M for its context menu.
* **Keyboard-driven export menu** — Ctrl+E in a result grid now opens the export menu with keyboard focus in it. J and K or the arrows move through the save and copy formats, Enter saves or copies in the highlighted format and Escape closes the menu and returns focus to the grid. macOS uses Cmd+E.
* **Result toolbar in the table menu** — The context menu of a result grid (M or Shift+F10) ends with a Toolbar submenu that lists the toolbar and header buttons shown at that moment, such as Export, Clear filter, Reset builder query, the view switch, Open query builder, the auto-refresh interval, Save or Revert all changes, chart Stats, Save chart, Maximize and Hide, each with its shortcut. Shift+F clears the WHERE filter of a table and reloads its rows, as the × in the filter field does.
* **Switch result views from the keyboard** — Shift+T in a result grid shows the result's next view (Data or Grid, JSON, Chart and the others it offers), wrapping, with the keyboard kept in the results. It works in a table and in the results of a query, where Alt+L and Alt+H keep switching result tabs. The Toolbar submenu of the M menu lists the views not shown as Show entries.
* **Keyboard focus in the side panels** — Ctrl+L in a result grid now moves focus into the value panel, row inspector, document panel or query builder open beside it, and Ctrl+H or Escape go back to the grid. Inside, J and K or the arrows scroll a line, Ctrl+D and Ctrl+U or Page Down and Page Up scroll a page, G and Shift+G go to the top and end, and Enter edits the value panel's text, with Escape to stop editing. The keys are listed under the Inspector context in Settings > Keybindings.
* **Value panel and row inspector buttons from the keyboard** — M (or Shift+F10) now opens the grid's context menu from inside the value panel or row inspector too, and its Toolbar submenu lists the open panel's buttons: the value panel's other formats, word wrap, Format, Compact and, once the value changed, Revert and Save, and the row inspector's Pin or Unpin. Before, those buttons needed the pointer.
* **Keyboard access to query result tabs** — In the results of a query, Alt+L and Alt+H show the next and previous result tab, wrapping at either end, and Alt+W closes the tab shown, returning focus to the editor when it was the last one. The pane actions menu of the code editor now also lists Next and Previous result tab, Close result tab, Maximize or Restore results and Hide or Show results while the query has results. Z and Ctrl+Shift+R maximize the results or restore the split, and Ctrl+Shift+E hides or shows them, in step with the header's maximize and hide buttons. macOS uses Cmd+Shift instead of Ctrl+Shift.
* **Keyboard access to the context bar targets** — Enter on the targets list of the execution context bar, shown for sources such as log groups and event streams, now opens the list with keyboard focus: J and K move, Space checks or unchecks a target, and Enter or Escape close the list and return focus to the bar. Before, Enter only opened the list and the pointer had to pick the targets.
* **Keyboard-driven background tasks panel** — With the tasks panel focused (Ctrl+Shift+4), J and K or the arrows move a selection over the tasks, G and Shift+G jump to the first and last, Space or Enter shows or hides the selected task's output, C cancels it, X dismisses it once it has finished and Shift+X clears the finished tasks. M or Shift+F10 opens a menu with the same actions and Hide the tasks panel. Clear finished tasks is also in the command palette. Before, J and K were bound but did nothing, and every task action needed the pointer.
* **Keyboard-driven notifications center** — While the notifications popover is open it keeps the keyboard: J and K or the arrows move a selection over its rows, G and Shift+G jump to the first and last, Enter opens the selected row (an approval in the MCP approvals tab, an error in Audit, the update's release notes, a finished job in the tasks panel), R marks it read, X dismisses it, I installs the listed update, Alt+L and Alt+H switch the filter, Shift+R marks all read and Shift+X clears the read rows. Escape or Ctrl+Shift+B closes it. Before, only Escape and the bell shortcut worked there.
* **Toast buttons from the keyboard** — Ctrl+Shift+Y opens a menu of the newest toast's buttons, such as Copy, View in Audit or Reconnect now, plus Show or Hide details and Dismiss. J and K move, Enter runs the button and Escape closes the menu. It is also in the command palette as Open toast actions. macOS uses Cmd+Shift+Y.
* **Switch the query history lists from the keyboard** — Alt+L and Alt+H show the next and previous list of the query history, Recent or Saved, from the list and from its search, rename and save fields. On macOS, where Option with a letter types a character, the fields keep the key. The keys are listed under the History context in Settings > Keybindings.
* **Keyboard keys for the SQL and query previews** — In the SQL Preview and Query Preview dialogs, Enter or Ctrl+C copies the query and closes the dialog, as the Copy button does, J and K or the arrows scroll the query a line, and Page Up and Page Down scroll it a page. macOS uses Cmd+C. The keys are listed under the SQL Preview context in Settings > Keybindings.
* **Reorder tabs from the keyboard** — Ctrl+Shift+Page Up and Ctrl+Shift+Page Down move the active tab one place left or right, as dragging it does. Both are also command palette entries (Move tab left, Move tab right). They use Ctrl on macOS too, like Ctrl+Tab.
* **Keyboard-driven SQL query builder** — After Ctrl+L moves focus from a table's grid into the query builder, J and K move a cursor over its rows (columns, WHERE conditions and groups, joins, grouping, sort keys, assignments and execution options), H and L move between a row's fields, and Enter or I types in the field, opens its dropdown or presses its button. A adds a condition, join, sort key or assignment, Shift+A adds a filter group, X or D removes the row, Space flips AND / OR, ASC / DESC or a column's checkbox, Alt+L and Alt+H switch between SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE, Ctrl+Enter runs and Ctrl+S saves. M or Shift+F10 opens a menu with the row's actions, Run, Open in Editor, Save, Reset, the modes and Close. Escape leaves a field and then the builder. A keyboard run goes through the same confirmation and mutation policy as the Run button. The keys are listed under the Query Builder context in Settings > Keybindings. macOS uses Cmd instead of Ctrl for the run and save chords.
* **Keyboard-driven document builder** — The document builder of a collection takes the same keys after Ctrl+L: J and K move over the query name, the saved queries while their list is open, the filter groups and conditions, the projection, the sort keys with limit and skip, and the group stage; H and L move between a row's fields. Enter on a field opens the field picker with its search focused, where typing a path and Enter picks it; Enter on an operator opens the operator list, driven by J, K and Enter; Enter on a value types in it. A adds a condition, projected field, sort key, group key or accumulator, Shift+A adds a group, X removes the row, Space flips all-of / any-of, a switch or a sort direction, Shift+J and Shift+K move a sort key, Alt+L and Alt+H switch between Find and Aggregate, Ctrl+Enter finds or runs the pipeline and keeps the keyboard in the builder, and M lists the row's actions with Find or Run pipeline, Open in editor, Save, the saved queries, the modes and Close. The keys are listed under the Document Builder context in Settings > Keybindings.
* **Keyboard-driven charts** — Chart tabs now take the keyboard: H and L highlight the previous and next point of the focused series, G and Shift+G the first and last, J and K move the point to the neighboring series, and the crosshair and readout follow it as they follow the pointer. Space hides or shows the focused series, Alt+L and Alt+H switch the chart type, ] and [ step the time range (Custom included), F5 runs the chart again and Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on macOS) saves it, with Enter and Escape in the name prompt. M or Shift+F10 lists the rest of the toolbar: auto-refresh interval, the custom range controls and Apply, the X, Y, Group and Aggregation pickers (J and K move, Enter picks, Space toggles a Y column, H and L switch picker), Stats and the metric picker controls. The chart view of a result takes the same point keys, and its table menu's Toolbar entry lists the chart type, axis pickers and time range.
* **Keyboard-driven dashboards** — A dashboard tab now takes keymap keys in View and Edit mode, listed under the Dashboard context in Settings > Keybindings: H, J, K, L or the arrows select a panel (the nearest one on the next row for J and K), G and Shift+G the first and last, and a ring marks it. Enter or I opens the panel, so a chart panel takes the chart keys and an inspector panel the table keys until Escape; C configures it, R or F2 renames it, X or Delete removes it, Space folds a divider's section and A adds a panel. In Edit mode Shift with H, J, K or L moves the panel one grid cell and Alt+Shift with them resizes it, refused like a drag when it would leave the grid or cover another panel. Alt+L and Alt+H switch View and Edit, ] and [ step the shared time range, F5 refreshes, and M or Shift+F10 lists all of it with the auto-refresh interval and the custom range controls. In the Configure popover H and L open the axis pickers, J and K move, Space or Enter pick and Alt+L and Alt+H switch the chart type.
* **A dashboard chart panel's own auto-refresh from the keyboard** — With a chart panel opened (Enter), M now also lists the panel's own auto-refresh interval, which opens its interval list with keyboard focus. The dashboard's interval stays a separate entry. Before, only the pointer reached a panel's own interval.
* **Connection imports from the keyboard** — In the Connection Manager's driver list, I opens Import connections and Shift+I opens Import from another client, and both buttons show their keys. Typed into the driver filter, the letter stays text. Import from another client is also a command of its own in Settings > Keybindings.
* **Keyboard-driven Add Panel dialog** — Alt+L and Alt+H switch the dialog's tabs. From the search the arrows move through the chart list and Enter adds the checked charts, or the highlighted one when none is checked. Tab moves into a list, where J and K move, G and Shift+G jump, Space checks a chart or picks a namespace or metric, H and L switch between the Metric tab's two lists and / goes back to the search.
* **Keyboard access to instance inspectors** — An instance inspector tab now takes the table keys, M opens the selected row's context menu with the driver's row actions (such as Kill session), Enter and Escape answer the confirmation, and F5 fetches a fresh snapshot.
* **Keyboard-driven MCP approvals** — The MCP approvals tab now takes keymap keys, listed under the MCP Approvals context in Settings > Keybindings: J and K or the arrows move over the pending calls, G and Shift+G jump to the first and last, A approves and R rejects the selected call, Enter or I types the rejection reason and Escape returns to the list, F5 reloads, and M or Shift+F10 lists the same actions. Approve and Reject can be rebound, and the buttons show the keys in effect.
* **Keyboard-driven schema diff** — A schema diff tab now takes the keyboard: J and K or the arrows move a cursor over the comparison mode, the reference databases, connections or snapshots, Compute, every applicable change and the Preview DDL and Apply buttons, H and L move between a row's buttons, Enter presses the one under the cursor, Space checks or unchecks a change and F5 computes again. M or Shift+F10 lists Compute, Preview DDL, Apply and the two modes. Apply keeps its confirmation. Before, the tab dropped every key.
* **Keyboard access to dump analysis** — In a dump analysis tab, Alt+L and Alt+H move between the Largest keys and By prefix tables, Escape cancels an analysis that is still reading the file, and M lists the other table, a sort per column of the table the keyboard is in and Cancel. Before, the second table, the column sorts and Cancel needed the pointer.
* **Keyboard access to object storage** — In the object browser, M now opens the selected row's menu (before, only a right click did), which also lists Open in system viewer for an object and the listing's buttons: Upload, New folder, Copy the current path, Load more, Show as a list or a tree, and, while a preview shows them, View versions, Load anyway and Discard. With no row selected, M lists the same buttons. In the bucket list, M lists Browse, Calculate size, New bucket and Refresh. In an object editor tab, Escape takes the keyboard out of the text, Enter puts it back, and M then lists Save, Discard, Find, the Auto / Raw interpretation, Reload and Load anyway.
* **Keyboard access to the key-value browser's buttons** — The M menu of the key-value browser now also lists the value panel's buttons (reload the value, the other View as choices and the decompression list of a string value, which opens with keyboard focus, preview or load a large value, a stream's pending entries and claim form) and the toolbar's (tree or list layout, auto-refresh interval, bulk delete, and Stop or Search whole keyspace during a filtered scan). Alt+L and Alt+H step the key type filter, and the mode of the open expiry editor.
* **Keyboard access to the document query bar** — In a document collection, the Toolbar submenu of the M menu now lists the Builder button as Open query builder, or Close builder while the builder is open, Find, Query history, Back to the documents while stepped into a nested value, the other views and, while a commit conflict shows, Reload document and Apply my change; Save all changes and Revert all changes run the edit bar's Commit and Revert. Query history opens the history menu with keyboard focus: J and K move, Enter reruns the query and Escape closes it. Shift+F empties the filter slot and finds, and Alt+L and Alt+H move between the Documents, Schema and Aggregate views.
* **Keyboard access to the audit viewer's export and view switch** — In the audit viewer, Ctrl+E (Cmd+E on macOS) opens the Export menu with keyboard focus: J and K move between CSV and JSON, Enter exports and Escape closes it. Alt+L and Alt+H switch the audit log between the event table and the chart. A row's M menu now also offers Copy row as JSON and, for an agent call parked for approval, Open approval, as the row's detail does.
* **Schema diagram view controls in the context menu** — The schema diagram's M menu now also lists Reset view (100%), Fit to view, Arrange tables, Show column types and Show indexes, which only the toolbar offered before.
* **M opens the pane actions where the results have no menu** — In a results area whose document has no context menu of its own, M and Shift+F10 now open the pane actions menu instead of doing nothing.
* **Rebindable settings keys** — The keys of the settings sections are now keymap commands of the Settings Window context, listed and rebindable in Settings > Keybindings: N, D and I add, delete and import in the profile lists (proxies, SSH tunnels, auth profiles, hooks, services, MCP), and in the key bindings editor R resets the selected binding, P edits its context, Delete or Backspace removes its shortcut, F focuses the filter, and the new Shift+R and C reset every binding and open the context filter. The About page's two links, and the Open browser, Copy URL and Cancel buttons of a login that waits for the browser, are now in the keyboard ring.
* **Vim mode in every multi-line editor** — With Settings > General > Vim mode on, Vim editing now also works in the S3 object editor tab, the object browser's preview editor, the cell editor and document preview dialogs, the import dashboard's JSON editor, the add panel dialog's query editor, the value panel, and a document collection's JSON view and aggregation pipeline. Read-only viewers take motions, Visual selection and yanks: a decoded view in the object browser's preview, the document tree's Raw JSON view, the query builder's SQL preview, the SQL and query preview dialogs and an external audit event's details. Outside the code editor the first Escape leaves Insert mode and the next one does what Escape did before (close the dialog, leave the editor), and Enter in Normal mode moves down instead of confirming a dialog. Turning the setting on or off updates open editors at once.
* **Vim leader key** — In Vim Normal and Visual modes, Space followed by a second key runs a command without leaving the home row: Space A opens the pane actions menu, Space R runs the query, Space E explains it, Space S saves, Space F opens the find panel, Space H and Space L switch the panel's tab and Space P opens the command palette. A key no sequence uses, or no key within a second, leaves Space doing nothing, and Insert mode still types a space. The sequences work in every editor with Vim mode. Inside a dialog they belong to the dialog: Space S saves the cell editor or the document preview, or confirms Import dashboard, Space F opens the editor's find panel, and a command the dialog has no use for does nothing and never reaches the document behind it. They are listed and rebindable under Vim Normal in Settings > Keybindings, where keys recorded after the leader keep following it. Settings > General > Leader key switches the leader to comma or backslash, and open editors follow when you save. Explain query is also a keymap command of its own. The Vim mode setting now reads Vim mode in editors.

### Changed

* **MongoDB extended JSON dates** — `{"$date": "<RFC 3339>"}` in the query bar, in aggregation pipelines and in document edits is now stored as a date. An invalid date string there now fails with an error instead of being saved as a nested object.
* **Global shortcuts while typing** — Shortcuts that hold Ctrl or Cmd, such as Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+9, Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Shift+P, now work while a text field outside a dialog has focus, such as the sidebar search or the execution context bar. Letters, Tab, Escape, Enter and the arrows stay with the field, and dialogs, menus, dropdowns and pickers keep the shortcuts out until they close.
* **Tab in the code editor** — In Vim Normal and Visual modes, Tab and Shift+Tab now move focus to the next or previous pane instead of doing nothing. Insert mode and editors without Vim keep Tab for indentation.
* **Buttons activate on release** — Buttons, menu rows, list rows and links that acted as soon as the mouse button went down, such as chart axis pickers, dropdown items, the window controls, key-value rows and the tab close button, now act when the button is released and are exposed to assistive technology as clickable. Drag handles, resize grips and dismissing a menu by pressing outside it still act on press.
* **Ctrl+Shift+X clears the error badge** — Opening the most recent error in the audit viewer with Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on macOS) now also clears the unread count on the status bar's error badge, as a click on the badge does.
* **Dashboard panel keys** — Enter on a selected dashboard panel now opens it for the keyboard instead of opening its Configure popover, which moved to C. The arrow keys, Enter, F2 and Delete are now rebindable keymap commands, joined by H, J, K and L; Backspace no longer removes a panel (X does).
* **Decoded S3 objects take the keyboard** — A decoded (non-raw) view in the S3 object editor tab and the object browser preview is now a focusable read-only editor instead of a disabled one, so its text can be selected, copied and moved through with Vim motions.
* **SQL preview with Vim mode** — With Vim mode on, the SQL and query preview dialogs open with the keyboard in the query, so J and K move the cursor instead of scrolling the dialog. Without Vim mode they scroll as before.

### Fixed

* **Linux AppImage packaging** — Bundle the shared-library dependency closure, including xkbcommon-x11 and runtime-loaded fontconfig, and build both Linux architectures on Ubuntu 22.04 rather than the newer runner libraries. CI checks the produced AppImages for missing dependencies, GLIBC requirements above 2.35 and early startup failure under Xvfb. AppImage downloads are now named `dbflux-x86_64.AppImage` and `dbflux-aarch64.AppImage`, without the old filename aliases; host graphics drivers are still required.
* **MySQL functional indexes no longer crash DBFlux** — On MySQL 8 and Aurora MySQL 3, loading the details of a table with a functional index, such as `INDEX ((lower(email)))`, no longer aborts the app. The index lists its expression, for example ``(lower(`email`))``.
* **MCP connections with AWS SSO auth profiles** — The MCP server now lists AWS auth profiles from `~/.aws` the way the app does, so a Managed (SSM) connection that uses an AWS SSO profile no longer fails with "Managed access requires an auth profile".
* **Point inspector and Show in tree in table charts** — The chart of a table or collection tab now shows the point inspector for the point under the pointer or the point picked with H and L: the series, time and value, and every column of the row behind it. Show in tree, from the inspector or the table menu's Toolbar entry, selects that row in the table and scrolls to it, leaving a chart-only view for the table. Before, the inspector never appeared. Charts of query editor results still show no inspector.
* **Row actions in the keyboard menu** — The context menu of a result row opened with M or Shift+F10 now lists the driver's row actions, such as Kill session in an instance inspector, which only a right click showed before.
* **Tab in the find panel** — Tab and Shift+Tab no longer get stuck in the editor's find panel when the replace field is hidden: they move focus between panes. With the replace field shown they still switch between the two fields.
* **Escape in the sidebar search** — Escape in the sidebar search field now returns focus to the tree and keeps the typed filter.
* **Sidebar cursor on focus** — When the sidebar tree gains focus with no row selected, from the search field, Ctrl+H or focus on launch, it now selects the row selected last, or the first row, so H, L and Enter act on the first press. Before, J had to be pressed first. A selection already in place is kept.
* **L connects a disconnected connection** — L on a disconnected connection in the sidebar now connects it and opens it once connected, as Enter and the row's chevron do. Before, only Enter connected. H on a connected connection still only collapses it.
* **Show in tree in the chart point inspector** — The Show in tree button now acts only when it is clicked, on release, instead of on any press inside the point inspector. While a chart point is under the pointer, the Toolbar submenu of the table menu offers the same action from the keyboard.
* **Slash in the query history fields** — Typing / in the query history's search, rename or save-name field now inserts the character. Before, the key was taken as the shortcut that focuses the search, so it never reached the field. From the history list, / still focuses the search.
* **Enter in the pane actions menu opened from the editor** — With the pane actions menu opened by Shift+F10 from the code editor text, Enter now runs the highlighted entry instead of breaking the line in the editor, and Escape returns the keyboard to the editor.
* **Tab in the key-value dialogs** — Tab and Shift+Tab in the New key and Add member dialogs now move through their fields like J and K. Before, Tab moved focus to the next pane behind the open dialog.
* **Enter confirms a dangerous console command** — When the key-value console asks to confirm a dangerous command, Enter in its empty field now runs it, as Run anyway does. Before, only the pointer could confirm it.
* **Discard from the keyboard in the object browser** — The dialog that asks what to do with unsaved edits when you leave an object now opens with Save focused and keeps Tab and Shift+Tab among Save, Cancel and Discard, so Enter or Space presses the focused button. Before, Enter saved, Escape cancelled and Discard needed the pointer.
* **Dropdowns in the auth profile form** — Enter on the provider field, or on a field that picks from a list, now opens that list with keyboard focus. Before, Enter did nothing there and only the pointer could choose.
* **Arrow, Page and tab keys in the connection manager** — Down and Up now move through the connection form like J and K. While a field is edited, Down, Up, Ctrl+L and Ctrl+H leave it for the next or previous field or tab, and Page Down and Page Up move an open dropdown a page. Before, those keys did nothing there.
* **Every field of the connection form from the keyboard** — The connection form's keyboard ring now continues past the password through the driver's other fields, such as the auth profile picker of AWS connections, then the SSL mode and the certificate pickers, and after a failed test it reaches the banner's Copy button. Before, those controls were skipped and needed the pointer.
* **Hook and MCP tabs of the connection form from the keyboard** — The Settings tab's ring now stops on each phase's hook dropdown, where Enter opens it with keyboard focus, and the MCP tab has a ring of its own: the MCP switch, the client filter, each listed client, the selected client's access switch and its role and policy pickers. Before, those controls needed the pointer.
* **Keyboard-driven migration wizard** — The migration wizard now takes keymap keys on every step, listed under the Migrate Wizard context in Settings > Keybindings. Alt+L and Alt+H continue and go back, and Ctrl+Enter continues or, on the Confirm step, starts the run. In Source and Target, J and K move through the tree, H and L collapse or expand a node or move between the two trees, and Enter or Space checks a table or chooses the target database. In Tables Mapping, H and L move between a row's target name, mode and Columns, and Enter types the name, opens the mode list or opens the column drill-in, whose source-column lists open with Enter. In Options, Enter types the segment size and Space flips the referential-integrity switch. On Confirm, Space checks the destructive-plan acknowledgment and Shift+J and Shift+K reorder the load order. M lists the footer and step buttons, including Set all to a mode, Cancel migration and Close. macOS uses Cmd+Enter.
* **Typing in the document tree search** — The search field of a document tree now types every letter. Before, letters the tree binds, such as J, K, H, L, G, E, T, R and N, ran tree actions instead of reaching the field, and the field took the keyboard back on every redraw. Enter in the field now returns the keyboard to the tree with the matches kept, so N and Shift+N step through them, and Escape closes the search. The inline value editor keeps its letters too.
* **Tab inside dialogs** — Tab and Shift+Tab now cycle through the controls of an open dialog and wrap around, instead of moving focus to the panels behind it.
* **Vulnerable website dependencies** — The pnpm workspaces of the website and of its MCP server override vulnerable transitive dependencies with patched versions, such as `undici` and `sharp`.
* **Images in the versioned docs** — The versioned documentation build now mirrors `resources/dbflux.png` from each version's git ref next to the markdown it renders, so images the rendered documents reference, such as the README's, load on every published version instead of showing a broken image.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

* **Typing in the cell editor and document preview** — The cell editor and the document preview dialogs put the keyboard in their text editor when they open, so typing works without clicking it first; Escape and the save shortcut still work from the editor.
* **Letters in connection manager text fields** — Typing `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` and `/` in the connection manager's text fields, such as the driver filter, inserts them instead of running navigation; with no text field focused they still navigate.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

* **Editing in the object browser preview** — The text preview of an object's own content accepts typing again, so its Save and Discard buttons work; a decoded view (gzip, MessagePack and similar) stays read-only.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

* **Vim search uses the find panel** — In Vim mode, `/` opens the editor's find panel instead of a separate search prompt. Enter and Shift+Enter move the cursor to the next or previous match and keep the panel open, Esc closes it and keeps the query for `n` and `N`, and Ctrl+J returns to the editor.
* **Pane navigation in the code editor** — Ctrl+H, Ctrl+J and Ctrl+K move focus between panes in the code editor with or without Vim, as everywhere else in the app. Find and replace moves to Ctrl+Shift+H on Linux and Windows.

### Fixed

* **Vim keys in the find panel** — Typing in the editor's find panel no longer runs Vim commands, so letters such as `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` reach the search field.
* **Ctrl+H and Ctrl+F in text fields** — Text fields without search no longer swallow Ctrl+H and Ctrl+F, so the app shortcuts bound to those keys run.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

* **Text on macOS** — Text renders again on macOS. Version 0.8.0 was built without the macOS text system, so every label, input and menu was blank (#768).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

* **Bolt Byzantium redesign** — New look across the whole app in dark and light: Archivo and JetBrains Mono type, byzantium accent, chamfered controls, and an islands layout where the sidebar, documents, inspectors and side panels float as separate panels. Settings and the Connection Manager follow the same layout. The theme choices are Follow system, Dark and Light.

* **Notifications center** — The title-bar bell opens a popover with pending MCP approvals, user-facing errors, available updates and finished long tasks, with an unread badge colored by urgency. Approvals are reviewed in the approvals tab; the bell never approves anything.

* **MCP approvals and Migrate data as tabs** — Both open as document tabs instead of overlays, so the app stays usable while they are open. Rejecting an MCP request can carry a reason that the agent reads back and the audit log records. One migration runs at a time.

* **Editor run markers** — Each statement gets a run marker in the gutter, the statement under the cursor is highlighted, and the toolbar shows the statement count and the last run time. File-backed scripts show their path and saved state. Results gain a Data / JSON / Chart switch, a search box that filters rows, content-sized columns and a read-only footer.

* **Query history as a side panel** — History opens as a panel next to the editor instead of a modal.

* **Aggregate view for document collections** — Collections on drivers that support it (MongoDB) gain an Aggregate view with a JSON pipeline editor and read-only results. Pipelines with `$out` or `$merge` go through the dangerous-query confirmation and are recorded in the audit log.

* **Redis key list** — Keys can be browsed as a namespace tree or a list with TTL and size columns, filtered by type on the server, and deleted in bulk by pattern with a preview. Key expiry can be edited, JSON and hex views are available for strings, sorted sets and streams have dedicated panes, and a command console runs against the open database.

* **Document collections** — Collections open in the tree view, have a schema view sampled from the collection, and a Document side panel that shows the selected document as a typed tree with pending edits highlighted. The query bar slots have examples and tooltips.

* **Editable keybindings** — Settings > Keybindings lists every command by context and records new chords, including multi-key sequences.

* **Per-class MCP approvals** — Each policy sets Allow, Ask or Deny per execution class. New policies allow metadata and reads and ask for everything that changes data.

* **Row inspector** — Fields show their type and a boxed value, the header shows the primary key, and references list incoming rows with their counts.

* **Sidebar** — Connected profiles show their round-trip latency, object-storage profiles list their buckets, empty Redis databases fold into one row, and object menus are captioned with the qualified name.

* **Object storage** — The buckets table has a details strip (region, versioning, encryption, public access, size) and the object browser selects the first object on open.

* **Update checks and What's new** — Settings > Updates checks GitHub releases on the chosen channel; available updates appear in the notifications center, and a welcome dialog and a What's new dialog show on first run and after an update.

* **Schema diagram details** — The diagram fits every table on open, and selecting a table opens a panel with its indexes, foreign keys and the tables that reference it.

* **Vim single-character replace** — Normal `r{char}` replaces the character under the cursor, and `Nr{char}` the next N characters on the line, as one undo step; the cursor stays on the first replaced character. It does nothing when fewer than N characters remain before the line ending, on an empty line, or in read-only editors. `r` with `Enter` replaces the characters with one line break that keeps the line's indentation, and `r` with `Tab` writes tabs. `Escape`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, the arrow keys, and leaving the editor cancel without editing; shortcuts cancel and still run. The character can come from an input method (IME). Live UI and IME validation are not claimed.

* **Vim Replace mode** — `R` enters Replace mode, shown as `REPLACE`. Typed characters overwrite the character under the cursor and are appended at a line ending; `Backspace` restores what the session overwrote; `Escape` returns to Normal. The session is one undo step, and read-only editors ignore `R`. Text that arrives without a key press, such as an IME commit, is inserted rather than overwriting. A count before `R` is ignored.

* **Vim Visual Block change** — Visual Block `c` deletes the block columns on every row that reaches the block's left column and enters Insert on the first of those rows; `Escape` inserts the typed text at the same column of the other rows, all in one undo step. Typed text containing a line break is not copied, and leaving the editor ends Insert without copying. Read-only editors keep the selection.

* **Vim Visual character and line change** — `c` changes inclusive selected characters or logical lines through native editing and enters Insert for replacement. One ordinary undo restores the original text and collapsed anchor. Selected-query bytes remain unchanged. Read-only changes leave the selection intact without entering Insert; an empty character or line selection enters Insert without deleting text. Linewise changes handle a trailing empty logical row after LF or CRLF. The 1000-change undo cap, stale-IME limitation, and lack of live UI validation still apply.

* **Vim Normal-mode change commands** — `c` accepts characterwise `h` / `l`, linewise `j` / `k`, word motions `w` / `W` / `e` / `E` / `b` / `B`, and linewise `gg` / `G`, alongside `cc`. `cw` changes through the next `w` boundary. Prefix and inner counts multiply (`2c3w` spans six motions); absolute targets clamp to 1-based rows (`2c3G` targets row 6, while bare `cG` targets the last row). Linewise changes preserve the separator before the following row; counted `cc` includes existing LF or CRLF terminators. Native deletion and Insert replacement form one undo step in ordinary sessions with the first caret restored; read-only changes do nothing. A Vim redo key remains unsupported. Undo groups cap at 1000 changes, so long sessions may require multiple steps. A late stale IME unmark after the next composition starts may prematurely commit the active native composition and split the Vim undo group; transitioning to read-only or Normal finalizes displayed preedit as-is instead of accepting a later candidate. Full IME safety and live UI validation are not claimed.

* **Vim local marks in code editors** — Normal-mode `m{a-z}` sets or
  overwrites a per-document lowercase mark; `'{a-z}` jumps to its line's first
  non-blank character, while backtick followed by the letter jumps to its exact
  position, clamped to a Normal cursor. Marks work in read-only editors and
  follow native edits, IME commits, undo, and redo. Insertions at a mark move
  it after inserted text; deletion or replacement of marked content collapses
  it to the changed range's start, so undo need not restore the deleted-interior
  position. Wholesale value replacement, disabling Vim, or closing the document
  clears marks; they are not shared across tabs or sessions. Desktop IME and
  rendered UI validation remain pending.

* **Vim literal search in code editors** — In Normal mode, `/` opens a native
  text prompt; `Enter` searches forward from the cursor with wrap and
  case-sensitive literal matching. `Escape` cancels without changing the cursor
  or last query. Counted `n` / `N` repeat forward / backward, including in
  read-only editors. Each tab retains its own search query; `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`
  leave focus in the prompt without action. Regex and Vim-style search
  highlighting are not supported; desktop IME and rendered UI validation remain
  pending.

* **Vim pending keys in the code-pane strip** — Shows incomplete raw key
  sequences such as `2`, `2d3`, and `4g`. The sequence clears on completion,
  interruption, focus loss, `Escape`, or `Tab`; no command history or workspace
  status-bar display is added.

* **Vim absolute-line motions** — Normal and Visual `gg` / `G` move to the
  first / last logical line; `Ngg` / `NG` target a clamped 1-based absolute
  line. Visual selection extends; interrupted or unfocused pending `g` clears.
  Normal `d` / `y` with `gg` / `G` now deletes / yanks whole lines through
  the clamped absolute target (bare `gg`: first; bare `G`: last). Prefix or
  inner counts target a 1-based row; together they multiply (`2d3G`: row 6),
  so `1dG` differs from bare `dG`. Read-only deletion is a no-op; yank still
  copies to the clipboard, and deletion is one undo step.

* **Vim Visual selection operators** — Visual character, line, and block
  selections support `d` / `x` deletion and `y` yank to the system clipboard.
  Block deletion uses disjoint row ranges in one undo step. An empty selection
  returns to Normal without editing or changing the clipboard; read-only
  deletion keeps the selection with no effect, while yank still works. `dd`
  and `cc` remain Normal-only.

* **Vim horizontal and vertical operators** — Normal-mode `d` and `y`
  accept `h`/`l` as characterwise motions and `j`/`k` as linewise motions.
  Operator and motion counts multiply (`2d3j` spans six lines). Yanks use
  the system clipboard; read-only deletes do nothing, and each delete is
  one undo step. This is not full Vim compatibility.

* **Vim word-motion operators** — Normal-mode `d` and `y` accept `w`/`W`,
  `e`/`E`, and `b`/`B`. Operator and motion counts multiply (`2d3w`);
  `w`/`b` ranges exclude the destination and `e` ranges include it (also
  for uppercase variants). Yanks use the system clipboard, read-only deletes
  do nothing, and each delete is one undo step. Normal `c` now supports these
  word motions and `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`; this is not full Vim compatibility.

* **Whole-line Vim commands** — Normal-mode `dd` deletes and `yy` copies whole
  logical lines to the system clipboard. Prefix counts and counts between the
  repeated keys apply, stopping at EOF. Existing line endings are preserved in
  yanks; deleting the final line removes its preceding separator. Read-only
  `dd` does nothing, and each counted deletion is one undo step.

* **Expanded Vim editing in code editors** — Normal mode now supports `a`/`A`/`I`
  insertion positions, `e`/`E`/`w`/`W`/`b`/`B` word motions, motion counts,
  and counted `x`/`u`. `v` and `V` now select characters or whole lines using
  real editor ranges; motions and counts extend the selection, `Escape` exits,
  and `Ctrl+Enter` passes nonempty selected query text to execution. Normal
  `Ctrl+v` enters genuine multi-range, display-row rectangular Visual Block
  selection; Insert `Ctrl+v` still pastes. `Ctrl+Enter` joins ordered nonempty
  row fragments with newlines (as with mouse Alt-drag), falling back to the
  full buffer for whitespace-only selections. Block columns count Unicode
  scalars, so tabs, wide characters and combining graphemes may not align to
  visual cells. Live UI visual validation remains pending; pixel-perfect
  alignment is not claimed.

* **Opt-in Vim mode for code editors** — Settings → General → Editor adds a
  Vim mode toggle, off by default. Code editors then open in Normal mode,
  where `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` and `Enter` move, `i` enters Insert mode, `x` deletes
  a character and `u` undoes; `Escape` closes an open completion menu or
  returns to Normal mode. Normal mode inserts no text from any key, paste, or
  input method, and application shortcuts keep working. A strip under the
  editor shows `NORMAL` or `INSERT`.

### Changed

* **Menu and command wording** — Menus and command names use sentence case, and `…` marks only items that open a dialog that asks for more input.

* **Sidebar keys** — In the sidebar, `x` opens the drop confirmation for the selected table, collection or database, and `r` refreshes the selected object instead of the whole connection.

* **MongoDB aggregate classification** — Aggregates with `$out` or `$merge` are classified as writes, which also applies to MCP policies.

* **Background tasks panel** — The collapsed bar is gone; the status bar chip opens the panel, and focus cycling skips it while it is closed.

* **Usage guide** — The usage guide is split into task pages (Getting started, Schema browser, Editor, Results, Key-value, Documents, Query builder) and a separate Keyboard reference.

* **Editor queries now carry a row limit, and drivers that cannot enforce it
  refuse them.** Every query run from the query editor asks the driver for at
  most Settings → General → Execution Safety → **Editor row limit** rows
  (default 10,000, minimum 1, cannot be turned off). MongoDB, Redis, Turso,
  InfluxDB, ClickHouse, Redshift, CloudWatch, external RPC drivers, and
  DynamoDB writes cannot enforce a row limit, so editor queries on them now
  fail with an "Operation not supported" error before they run. Scripts,
  connection hooks, and metrics are unaffected, and no timeout is added.

* SQL Server explicit row limits retain at most N rows across every result set of a batch and flag actual omissions, including at zero; every set is drained, so later statements and mutations finish and late errors propagate. Explicit timeouts and bounded instance requests are refused before execution without clearing a pending cancellation; unbounded requests remain compatible. The row cap does not bound bytes, server work, or elapsed time; Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance were not verified.

* SQLite explicit row limits retain at most N rows across the row-producing statements of a request (including `PRAGMA`, `WITH`, `VALUES`, and `RETURNING`) and flag actual omissions, including at zero; every statement still runs to completion, so mutations finish and late errors propagate. Bounded multi-statement batches are split with SQLite's own lexer and run in order under that one budget, so statements after the budget is exhausted still run, and a failure stops the batch as it does without a limit. Explicit timeouts and bounded instance requests are refused before execution; unbounded requests remain compatible. The row cap does not bound memory, engine work, or elapsed time, and splitting a bounded batch is quadratic in statement length.

* PostgreSQL explicit row limits retain at most N rows across every statement of a request and flag actual omissions, including at zero. Bounded multi-statement batches, previously refused, run statement by statement through the typed streaming path under that one budget, so statements after the budget is exhausted still run and a failure stops the batch. The driver keeps the transaction boundaries of the unbounded simple-query run: statements outside a user transaction run in a transaction the driver commits or rolls back, a `BEGIN` in the script adopts earlier statements, and an open session transaction is joined. `PREPARE TRANSACTION`, and savepoint or chained commands after statements outside an explicit transaction, are refused before execution. Explicit timeouts and bounded instance requests are refused before execution without clearing a pending cancellation. A batch containing a SQL-standard `BEGIN ATOMIC` body fails with a syntax error instead of running.

* MySQL/MariaDB explicit row limits retain at most N rows across script/server result sets and flag actual omissions, including at zero; later mutations finish and errors propagate. Explicit timeouts and bounded instance requests are refused before execution; unbounded requests remain compatible. The row cap does not bound bytes, server work, engine allocation, or elapsed time; hosted MariaDB was not verified.

* ClickHouse and Redshift now refuse explicit query row limits (including zero) and statement timeouts before dispatch or preparation; unprotected queries retain existing behavior, including possible full-result buffering. ClickHouse HTTP timeout does not guarantee server cancellation, and the Redshift early-refusal regression uses PostgreSQL 16 protocol compatibility rather than a hosted Redshift cluster.

### Fixed

* **Credentials in connection strings** — Passwords in `postgresql://`, `mongodb+srv://`, `rediss://` and other URLs, and `password=` or `token=` parameters, are now redacted in audit events and driver error messages. The previous pattern missed `postgresql://`.

* **Quieter shutdown** — Closing the app no longer logs an error for drivers that cannot cancel a running query.

* **Vim Visual selection caret** — Visual character and line selections retain
  their selected text while rendering the caret at the active head, including
  upward motions and lines whose selection includes the next line's start.
  Native selection, blur, and IME take caret ownership back. Live visual
  verification remains pending.

* **Vim linewise yank of a trailing empty line** — `yy` and linewise `y` motions
  copy the existing LF or CRLF separator instead of an empty clipboard value.
  Unterminated lines and empty buffers do not gain a newline.

* **SQLite cancel is no longer lost at query start** — cancelling a SQLite
  query right after it started, before its first statement began running,
  did nothing: SQLite drops an interrupt that arrives before a statement
  steps, so the query ran on (forever, for an endless query). The query now
  checks the cancel request while it runs and ends as cancelled.

* **Chart group splits the lines** — a chart's Group binding was dropped
  before rendering and the chart engine never split series by it, so a
  measurement with tags `host=a` and `host=b` drew one line zigzagging
  between both hosts, and the axis bar showed `Group —`. The first text
  column now becomes the default group for a time-series collection when it
  holds at most 12 distinct values, and a group, default or picked in the
  axis bar, draws one line per value.

* **Stacked bars stack by timestamp** — Stacked Bar summed series by point
  position, so series with different timestamps, such as grouped hosts,
  piled values from different times into one bar. Bars now stack the values
  that share an X value, and a series with no value there adds nothing.

* **Bar chart ticks match the bars** — Bar and Stacked Bar generated Y tick
  labels from the padded or stacked range but drew bars and gridlines with
  the unpadded per-series range, so a Stacked Bar segment of 4.25 appeared
  above the "4" tick and the labels bunched at the bottom. Bars, gridlines,
  tick labels and hover now share one Y range. For Stacked Bar it runs from
  zero to the tallest stack.

* **Time-series measurements open as a chart** — opening a measurement on an
  InfluxDB connection showed a document tree, the toolbar read
  `SELECT * FROM <bucket>.<measurement>` and the status bar `find ...`,
  whatever the connection's query language. A collection on a time-series
  connection now offers the Data, Chart and JSON views and opens as a chart
  when the result has a time and a numeric column. Data shows a grid, and a
  refresh keeps the view you picked. The toolbar and the status bar show the
  query the driver runs, which drivers supply through
  `QueryGenerator::collection_browse_query`. For InfluxDB that is InfluxQL.

* **Active query prompt shows the whole query** — the "Active query running"
  prompt showed the running task's label, which the editor cuts at 80
  characters, so a longer query ended in "..." as in the status bar. The
  prompt now wraps the full query text and caps it at six lines, adding an
  ellipsis only when it does not fit. When several queries run at quit, it
  shows the longest-running one and counts the others.

* External RPC drivers now refuse a query that sets a row limit (including
  zero) or a statement timeout, both in the client before the request is sent
  and in the driver host before the plugin connection runs it. Previously the
  host passed those options through with nothing to guarantee the driver
  honored them. Queries without either option run as before.

* `START TRANSACTION` and `BEGIN` now work from the SQL editor on MySQL,
  including as the first statement of a script. MySQL 8.4 refused them with
  "This command is not supported in the prepared statement protocol yet".

* `F5` now refreshes the focused document (table data, bucket list, object
  listing, key browser), and the audit viewer's `r` refreshes the audit list
  instead of the connection schema. The buckets empty state showed `r refresh`,
  but `r` renames in that view; the hint now shows the key the keymap binds.

* Refreshing a table or collection grid with unsaved cell edits no longer
  drops them: the refresh key, the toolbar button and the command palette show
  a warning to save or revert first, and auto-refresh skips its tick.

* **SSO wizard account and role labels** — the account-ID and role inputs on
  the AWS SSO wizard's second and third steps had only placeholders. They now
  have visible labels, which are also their accessible names, and stable
  `sso-field-account-id` and `sso-field-role-name` ids, like the first step.
  The login modal's waiting indicator now animates while it waits for the
  browser; the elapsed caption still counts whole wall-clock seconds.

* UI automation: `set_text` and `set_value` now fill a text input addressed by
  its element id, and `click_element` accepts text inputs and focuses them for
  `type_text`. Previously both failed on every input, `set_text` with a
  misleading document-range error, so filling a form needed coordinates.

* **Extra hook inputs in the Connection Manager** — the Hooks section of the
  Settings tab shows the "Extra pre-connect" (and post-connect, pre-disconnect,
  post-disconnect) input next to its label again, so extra hooks can be bound
  from the form. Each input takes comma-separated hook IDs or names, shows the
  extras already bound when a connection is edited, is reachable with j/k, and
  is addressable as `cm-setting-<phase>_hook_extra`.

* **More English-only labels are translated** — the audit viewer's tab title,
  filter-bar labels and its category and level chips, the "Off" and "Custom"
  auto-refresh options, the Default and Compact style options in Settings, the
  short time-range presets (15m, 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d), and the dashboard-import
  and export-connection toasts now follow the selected language. Object-storage
  audit events showed a `NULL` category chip; they now show their category.

* The SQL editor warns once when any delivered result set actually omitted rows; the
  data grid shows the warning for its selected result set, even when no rows were
  retained. A result that merely fills its limit is not flagged, and discarded
  stale executions do not raise omission warnings.

* **Cancelled import and migration tables** — after a cancel, the Done screen
  of the import and migrate wizards lists every table, and the table the
  cancel stopped shows as cancelled with the rows it kept instead of
  completed. An import whose connection closed just before the run started
  now reports the error and returns to the configure step, where it used to
  sit on a running screen whose Cancel did nothing. The import configure step
  scrolls its table list, so a bundle with many tables no longer overflows
  the dialog.

* Redis, Turso, and InfluxDB now refuse requested row limits (including zero)
  or statement timeouts before execution with `NotSupported`, rather than
  dispatching commands, SQL, HTTP, or instance-context queries without those
  protections. Unprotected execution remains available; the default editor
  cannot promise these protections on these backends.
  
* **Checkbox names in Settings and the Connection Manager** — every checkbox in
  the Settings window and the Connection Manager now has the text shown next to
  it as its accessible name. In Settings > General all eight checkboxes
  (`vim-mode`, `restore-session`, `requires-preview`, ...) had no name, so a
  screen reader announced a bare checkbox and UI automation could only find them
  by id. Element ids and behavior are unchanged.

* **Audit export asks where to save** — exporting from the audit viewer now
  opens the same save dialog as the other exports, with a timestamped default
  name (`audit_export_<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.<csv|json>`), instead of writing to a
  fixed `~/Downloads/audit_export.*` path that a second export silently
  replaced. Cancelling writes nothing, and write failures are reported with a
  correlation id in the audit log.

* Reject MongoDB execution requests with row limits or statement timeouts before any operation dispatches.

* **Chart controls for missing features removed** — the chart toolbar's PNG
  button, the dashboard Configure popover's Export PNG action, and the point
  inspector's Annotate and Copy as query buttons are gone. They only showed a
  "coming in v0.7" toast or a disabled "Coming soon" label for features that
  do not exist. The point inspector keeps its Show in tree action.

* **CloudWatch query safety** — reject requested row limits and statement timeouts before Logs or Metrics dispatch; unprotected Logs queries retain the fixed SDK `StartQuery` limit of 1000, without a default timeout or server-work guarantee.

* **Audit degraded status** — Settings → Audit now shows a warning-colored dot
  when the audit database could not be opened, instead of the green "enabled"
  dot, and tells you to restart DBFlux. The copied "Audit cannot be enabled"
  error no longer repeats its prefix.

* The Redis key browser now fills each page across `SCAN` batches (and across
  masters on Cluster), bounded to 1000 round trips and 500 ms per page, so a
  sparse filter no longer returns empty pages. Keys repeated by `SCAN` appear
  once per page, and the page's key types are fetched in one pipeline instead
  of one `TYPE` round trip per key.

* **Prompt before abandoning a running query** — disconnecting a connection
  with a query still running, or closing the DBFlux window while any
  connection runs one, now opens the "Active query running" prompt instead of
  acting right away. **Cancel query** cancels the query and stays connected,
  **Keep waiting** changes nothing, and **Disconnect anyway** / **Quit anyway**
  cancels the query and continues. The prompt existed but nothing opened it.

* **Linux title-bar close follows the window-manager close** — the main
  window's in-app close button (client-side decorations) removed the window
  directly, skipping the running-query prompt and the graceful shutdown that
  saves pending edits and closes connections. It now takes the same path as
  closing through the window manager. Other windows keep their close behavior.

* **Cancelling a query no longer freezes the UI** — SQLite's cancel waited
  for the connection lock that the running query holds, so cancelling from the
  editor, the tasks panel, or the running-query prompt froze the window until
  the query ended (forever, for an endless query). SQLite now interrupts
  without taking the lock, and driver cancels for every backend run off the UI
  thread, so a slow network cancel cannot stall it either.

* The key browser filter now passes input containing `*`, `?` or `[` through
  as a glob, so a prefix search such as `leaderboard*` works; plain text still
  matches anywhere in the key. The header count now reads as the number of
  keys on the current page instead of implying a total.

* **Sidebar menus and failed connections** — the Databases folder, the
  instance metric and inspector folders, and the metric, inspector and
  Instance Overview leaves now open their context menu from right click and
  the row button, as `m` already did, and **Open** on those leaves opens them.
  A failed connect now leaves a red error icon on the connection row, with the
  error in its tooltip and **Retry** in its menu, until a new attempt starts,
  the connection succeeds, or the connection is edited. The Saved Charts
  folder no longer offers a **New Saved Chart…** entry that did nothing, and
  index, foreign key and custom type rows offer no menu when the driver
  cannot generate SQL for them.

* **Driver picker arrow keys land on the card you see** — Up and Down in the
  Connection Manager driver picker moved four cards at a time while the window
  showed two per row, so the cursor landed on an unrelated driver. Each
  category section now uses a fixed two-column grid that fits the window, and
  Up/Down move to the card above or below, crossing into the neighboring
  section's matching column.

* **Tasks panel cancel and failed-task retention** — key-value scans, reads
  and mutations no longer show a cancel button, because no key-value driver
  can stop those calls once they start and cancelling only marked the task
  cancelled while the work (including a write) went on. Failed tasks now stay
  in the Tasks panel with a dismiss button instead of disappearing after 60
  seconds, so their error output remains readable; completed and cancelled
  tasks are still removed after 60 seconds.

* **Proxy details show readable labels** — the Access tab's proxy details
  card printed the proxy type and authentication as Rust debug output, such
  as `Http` and `Basic { username: "..." }`. It now shows translated labels:
  HTTP, HTTPS or SOCKS5, and None or Basic with the username.

* **Document tree and schema diagram keys in the keymap** — the document tree's
  keys and the schema diagram's zoom, pan, selection, table-move and layout
  keys now come from the app keymap instead of being hard-coded in each view,
  so Settings → Keybindings lists them under Document Tree and Schema Viz.
  The default keys are unchanged. The tree's `d d` delete sequence stays built
  into the tree, because a keymap entry holds a single keystroke.

* **The new-connection shortcut shown in the empty workspace works** — the
  empty workspace advertised `Ctrl+Shift+N` for a new connection, but nothing
  was bound to it. `Ctrl+Shift+N` (`Cmd+Shift+N` on macOS) now opens the
  Connection Manager, and every empty-state hint reads its chord from the
  keymap, so macOS shows `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`.


### Added

* **PostgreSQL bounded query execution** — single-statement row limits retain only the requested rows while draining execution to completion; unsupported bounded batches, instance catalog requests, and statement deadlines are rejected before execution.

* **DynamoDB execution safety** — requested timeouts and row-limited writes
  now fail before execution; scan/query use the smaller request/envelope cap
  including zero. PartiQL SELECT rejects zero limits and retains existing
  positive-limit first-page behavior. Limits do not bound bytes or server work;
  hosted AWS behavior was not validated.

* **Shared lazy object hierarchy and collapsed sidebar preview** — the sidebar
  and migration wizard share coordinated loading while keeping independent
  selection; collapsed sidebar entry reveals a temporary preview without
  changing the explicit collapse choice.

* **Opt-in UI automation for agents and tests** — a development build compiled
  with the `ui-automation` feature exposes each window to a local MCP server
  (vendored `gpui-mcp`) that can read the rendered element tree, click, type,
  run app commands and take screenshots. The feature is off by default and is
  never part of release builds; the bridge only accepts processes of the same
  user. On Wayland compositors, screenshots require running DBFlux under
  XWayland. Password, write-only and passphrase inputs now expose the password
  role to accessibility clients, so their value is never readable through the
  element tree, even while a show-password toggle displays it. See
  `docs/UI_AUTOMATION.md`.

* **Safe automatic Deep capture on connect and async snapshot picker** — a
  relational connection with a known database captures a Deep snapshot only
  when every table has loaded columns or sample fields. Creation metadata is
  collected where available; capture errors leave the connection open and do
  not persist a partial Deep snapshot. Cache hydration uses the exact row
  selected by the capture only while that connection remains current; older
  captures cannot prune newer ones at retention one.
  Historic snapshots are loaded in the background, filtered to existing
  profiles, and labeled by timestamp. Unknown databases (including Turso)
  fail closed rather than promising a snapshot on every connect.

* **Faithful MSSQL `CREATE TABLE` generation via schema diff** — the SQL
  Server driver now introspects full column type dimensions (Unicode lengths
  in characters with `MAX` support, byte lengths for character/binary types,
  decimal precision/scale, temporal scale, `float` precision; identity kept
  out of the type name) and reports identity seed/increment as exact
  server-converted text — `numeric(38,0)` identity values beyond any 64-bit
  integer survive verbatim — plus primary-key columns in declared key order,
  a completeness report, and named blockers for creation semantics it cannot
  reproduce (computed columns, user-defined/CLR types, sparse, `FILESTREAM`,
  `ROWGUIDCOL`, memory-optimized, system-versioned temporal, nonclustered
  primary keys, descending primary-key columns, identity `NOT FOR REPLICATION`,
  row/page compression, non-default filegroups, typed `xml` bound to an XML
  schema collection, and legacy-bound or permission-hidden default expressions
  that surface as named incompleteness). Notably, **every character-typed
  column currently refuses**: `sys.columns.collation_name` is non-null for
  all of them — even when the collation was only inherited from the source
  database default — and the target database's default collation is unknown
  at generation time, so only tables whose columns all have non-collated
  types can currently be generated. The schema-diff document forwards the
  reference side's metadata — live through the generic
  `table_creation_metadata` seam, or from a deep snapshot captured
  programmatically — to the target connection, which generates a faithful
  `CREATE TABLE` for both preview and apply and refuses when the metadata is
  missing, incomplete, or blocked, so old snapshots can never regenerate an
  identity-less table. At the generator stage, on-connect capture was shallow;
  the separate Deep capture described above can also persist creation
  metadata. A live reference needs nothing stored. No UI crate branches on
  driver identifiers. MSSQL connections also resolve the actual session
  database (`DB_NAME()`) at
  connect time for URI and direct/SSH default logins, so the driver reports
  the login's real default database instead of an unknown selection.

* **Structured table-creation metadata for faithful schema captures** — deep
  schema snapshots can now carry, per table, the creation details the legacy
  table shape cannot express: identity seed and increment as exact decimal
  strings (SQL Server allows `numeric(38,0)` magnitudes), explicit primary-key
  column order, a completeness report naming what the driver could not
  observe, and actionable blockers that rule out faithful `CREATE TABLE`
  generation. The metadata is a standalone type: the legacy RPC payloads and
  the on-the-wire table shape are untouched. Drivers expose it through new
  defaulted `Connection` seams (`table_creation_metadata` and
  `generate_code_with_creation_metadata`) that preserve existing behavior for
  every driver that has not opted in. Deep snapshot capture collects the
  metadata through those seams, persists it in a new nullable column on
  snapshot table rows (old databases upgrade in place and stay readable), and
  snapshot deduplication no longer discards a fresh capture just because the
  structural fingerprint is unchanged.

* **Key total in the Redis key browser** — with no filter set, the key browser
  now shows how many keys the whole keyspace holds next to the keys on the
  current page. Drivers report it through a new defaulted
  `KeyValueApi::key_count` seam: Redis answers with `DBSIZE`, and a Cluster
  connection sums `DBSIZE` over every master. External drivers carry it over
  driver RPC 1.5; against an older host the total is simply not shown.

* **Interactive schema visualization** — a table or a whole database can now be
  opened as a diagram of the schema instead of a list of objects. Tables render
  as nodes carrying their columns, primary keys and flags, and foreign keys as
  edges between them; the diagram pans by dragging, zooms on the cursor with the
  wheel or from the toolbar between 25% and 400%, and a node can be dragged to
  rearrange the layout. Arrow keys and `hjkl` walk the nodes, and the context
  menu switches between the left-right, snowflake and compact layouts, centers
  the view on a table, opens that table's schema inspector, and copies the
  diagram as DBML or as `CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE` DDL. The same two formats
  are behind the toolbar's Export button, next to the toggles for column types
  and indexes. Loading a large schema runs in the background and can be
  cancelled. The diagram is read-only: it displays the schema and exports it, and
  never issues DDL of its own.

* **Hook process trees are reclaimed on Windows when a hook is cancelled or
  times out** — cancelling a hook on Windows killed only the direct child, so a
  hook that spawned helpers left them orphaned. A managed hook now runs inside a
  Job Object: cancelling, timing out or aborting it reclaims the whole tree, as
  the Unix build already did through process groups. A detached hook still
  outlives the app unless it is cancelled, and a hook that finishes normally
  leaves its background processes running until DBFlux exits (the Unix build
  leaves them running after that too).

* **Applying a table's pending edits before its tab closes** — closing a table
  tab that holds staged, unapplied grid edits used to be a dead end: the
  unsaved-changes dialog listed the tab, but its action could not do anything
  with a data document, so the tab stayed open with a warning. The dialog now
  names what each entry's pending edits need — save for a file-backed document,
  apply for a table — and its apply action runs the grid's own Save all, so the
  mutations pass through the same mutation policy, table delete confirmation and
  error reporting as the button. The tab closes only once every staged edit has
  landed; a failed statement, a missing connection, or a dismissed delete
  confirmation leaves the tab open with its edits. Until quitting asks too, a
  quit still drops staged grid edits.

* **Toggle Comment in the code editors** — `Ctrl+/` (`Cmd+/` on macOS) comments
  every line the selection touches, or uncomments them when each touched line
  already carries the language's prefix, so the same chord works in the SQL
  editor and in Lua, Python, and Bash scripts. Blank lines are left alone, the
  viewport stays where it was, and a toggle on a bare caret walks the cursor to
  the next line. Read-only documents ignore the command. The command is also
  available in the command palette.

* **TursoDB driver** — connect to Turso Cloud and self-hosted libSQL
  (`sqld`) servers over HTTP with a URL and an auth token. The driver speaks
  the SQLite dialect and supports schema discovery (tables, views, columns,
  indexes, foreign keys, CHECK/UNIQUE constraints), typed grid CRUD, bound
  parameters, multi-statement scripts, the visual query builder, code
  generation, and CSV/JSON export. Interactive transactions work per editor
  tab: each tab runs on its own server stream through a new generic
  execution-session seam, so a `BEGIN` in one tab is never visible to grid
  edits, other tabs, or MCP calls, and closing the tab or changing its
  connection rolls the transaction back. Query cancellation, SSH tunnels,
  embedded replicas, and database switching are not supported yet.
* **Isolated execution sessions** — drivers can now expose an
  `ExecutionSessionFactory`; the editor, grid mutation executor, MCP server,
  and connection teardown route through it so a driver-owned session is
  opened, finished, and closed explicitly with cleanup failures surfaced.
  Existing drivers are unchanged.
* **Grammar-derived SQL keyword completion** — the SQL editor now completes
  the keywords its bundled tree-sitter grammar declares instead of a hand-kept
  list, so words the static list never carried (`EXPLAIN`, `VACUUM`, `WITH`,
  `RETURNING`, …) are suggested on every SQL-style language. A small hand-kept
  supplement covers what the grammar cannot supply: multi-word keywords
  (`GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`), the aggregate function names, spelling variants
  hidden behind a shared rule (`ILIKE`, `INTEGER`, `INT4`, …), and statements
  the grammar never defines (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `FETCH`, …).

* **Korean user interface (#529)** — the app's in-app interface strings (menus,
  dialogs, settings, error messages) are now available in Korean, and the
  language appears in Settings → General on its own with no configuration. This
  supersedes the Weblate translation PR #529. The translation was produced
  without a Korean-speaking reviewer, so terminology may read awkwardly in
  places, and any string not yet translated falls back to English. A new test
  now fails the build if any translated catalog drops or renames an English
  `%{placeholder}` — a failure that is otherwise silent in the UI.

### Fixed

* **Saving, filtering or paging no longer drops other unsaved grid edits** —
  after saving, inserting or deleting rows, the data grid reloaded and
  discarded the edits, inserts and deletes still staged on other rows. The
  reload now carries them over to the reloaded rows by primary key. An edited
  row that is no longer in the reloaded rows is dropped with a warning, and a
  result without a primary key keeps its rows and warns instead of reloading.
  Every other reload of the rows is now refused while unsaved edits exist,
  with one warning telling the user to save or revert them first: changing or
  clearing the filter, the context-menu filters, the row limit, the page keys
  and buttons, a server-side sort, the query builder's Run and Reset, the
  relational filter's re-run once foreign keys load, and a chart re-run. A
  staged insert or delete on its own now counts as an unsaved edit for every
  one of these checks, including refresh. Sorting a static result or a
  collection in memory carries the edits over to the reordered rows by primary
  key, and is refused with the same warning when the result has none.

* **Filters and mutation confirmation samples run on PostgreSQL** — the data
  grid sent visual SELECTs, their row counts and the sample rows of the
  UPDATE / DELETE confirmation dialog as placeholder SQL with separate bound
  values, but drivers execute the SQL text as is and never bind those values.
  Any filter with a value, including dotted relational filters such as
  `created_by.email = 'alice@example.com'`, failed on PostgreSQL with
  "expected 1 parameters but got 0", and a filtered mutation's confirmation
  dialog showed no sample rows. The values are now inlined as dialect literals
  before execution, the same way structured mutations already run, and
  non-ASCII identifiers survive that inlining.

* **Modal footers no longer cover the body** — the shared modal shell sized its
  body to its 96 px minimum instead of its content, so the footer covered the
  end of any taller body, such as the connection name in the Delete connection
  dialog. The body now grows to fit its content and scrolls only when the
  dialog reaches its maximum height.

* **Dropping a table runs the statement the preview shows** — the drop table
  dialog previewed `DROP TABLE ... CASCADE` whenever the table had dependents,
  which SQL Server and SQLite reject and MySQL ignores, while the drop itself
  ran `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` without `CASCADE` everywhere. Both now come from
  one dialect-owned builder: the dialog shows the exact statement that runs,
  `CASCADE` is used only on PostgreSQL and Redshift, and other databases list
  the dependent objects without claiming they will be dropped. The MCP
  `drop_table` tool and the generic schema drop use the same builder and
  return an error when `cascade` is requested on a database without it.

* **Missing PostgreSQL relations no longer open as empty tables** — asking a
  PostgreSQL connection for the details of a table or view that does not exist
  returned an empty structure instead of an error, so the grid showed a blank
  table. `table_details` now reports `ObjectNotFound` for absent relations;
  real zero-column tables and supported views, partitioned tables and
  partitions keep loading normally (#675).

* **Connection Manager inputs and tabs are named for assistive technology** —
  text inputs in the Connection Manager were announced by their placeholder
  (the Host input read as "localhost") and carried ids generated from runtime
  entity ids, so UI automation could not address them across runs. Each input
  now reports the label shown next to it and a stable id derived from its form
  field (`cm-field-host`, `cm-field-ssh_user`, `cm-setting-refresh_interval`).
  Document tabs and Connection Manager tabs are exposed as tabs inside a tab
  list, with the active tab reported as selected, instead of as buttons.

* UI automation: screenshots now wait until DBFlux has presented the frame that
  follows an action and, on Linux, until two consecutive captures match, so they
  no longer show the previous frame. The new `wait_for_idle` tool waits until
  the element tree stops changing and the window draws at most one frame per
  500 ms.

* UI automation: `focus_element` on a text input now focuses its editor, so a
  following `type_text` types into it instead of failing with "no active text
  input handler". `focus_element`, `click_element` and `double_click_element`
  click a text input inside its text area, near the left edge, instead of at
  its center, which in a narrow input could land on the clear or show-password
  button. Read-only inputs (the audit viewer's event details, the object
  browser's decoded preview, the query builder's SQL preview) now report
  `read_only` in the element tree, and `set_text` and `set_value` refuse them
  with an error instead of replacing text a user could not edit. DBFlux itself
  also ignores a value sent to a read-only input, whichever client sends it.

* **The MCP approvals overlay can be closed** — once opened, the approvals
  overlay stayed on screen until the audit viewer was opened. It now closes
  from the close button in its header, with Escape, or with a click on the
  dimmed area around it, and keyboard focus returns to where it was before.

* **PostgreSQL `NUMERIC` columns show their values** — `NUMERIC` and `DECIMAL`
  values read back as `NULL` in query results, table browsing, MCP
  `select_data`, exports, and the rows returned after an insert, update, or
  delete. They now show the exact decimal PostgreSQL stores, including the
  declared scale (`1123.40`), very large or very precise values, and `NaN`,
  `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`. A value that still cannot be decoded is reported
  as an unsupported type instead of passing for `NULL`.

* **PostgreSQL values that cannot be decoded no longer show as `NULL`** —
  `infinity` and `-infinity` dates and timestamps, and any other value the
  driver could not decode, read back as `NULL` in query results, table
  browsing, MCP `select_data`, exports, and the rows returned after an insert,
  update, or delete. Infinite dates and timestamps now show as `infinity` and
  `-infinity`, as PostgreSQL prints them. A value that still cannot be decoded
  is reported as an unsupported type and flags the result, and a real SQL
  `NULL` shows as `NULL` for every column type, including types without a
  decoder. The instance inspectors log the column and type of a cell they
  cannot decode and show it as unsupported. `numeric[]` arrays now show their
  exact decimals; `money` stays unsupported because its scale depends on the
  server's `lc_monetary` setting.

* **The inspector rail follows the active tab** — switching to a tab, or
  closing the active one, could leave the right-side rail showing the row
  inspector, value panel, or schema inspector of a tab that was no longer
  active. The tab that becomes active now decides what the rail shows, and the
  rail hides when that tab has nothing to show or when the last tab closes.
  Code and schema diagram tabs restore their inspector when you return to them.

* **A failed script no longer leaves the connection stuck in a transaction** —
  a script that opened a transaction and failed partway never reached its
  `COMMIT`, so the transaction stayed open on the connection every tab shares.
  On PostgreSQL every later query failed with `25P02` until a manual
  `ROLLBACK`. On MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and SQL Server later queries ran inside
  the leftover transaction, where its partial writes could be committed by
  accident. The driver now rolls back a transaction the failed script opened
  itself and leaves one that was already open, and the error says which of the
  two happened.

* Connection Manager forms: long field labels (such as Redis "Sentinel Master
  Name" and the InfluxDB default bucket/database) now wrap inside the label
  column instead of running into their input, single-choice options such as
  the Redis topology render as radio buttons instead of checkboxes, the secret
  input's placeholder follows its label (InfluxDB v2 shows "API Token", not
  "Password"), and the secret input sits where the driver form places it, so
  the S3 Secret Access Key follows the Access Key ID.

* **`ON COMMIT` no longer shows as a syntax error** — the editor flagged
  PostgreSQL's `ON COMMIT { DROP | DELETE ROWS | PRESERVE ROWS }` clause on
  `CREATE TEMP TABLE` as `Unexpected`, because the bundled SQL grammar has no
  rule for it. The clause is now skipped before the editor checks the syntax,
  and errors elsewhere in the script are still reported at their position.

* **The schema diagram follows the selected language** — its toolbar, context
  menu, layout and export menus, inspector, loading and error messages, toasts,
  tab title, and the sidebar entries that open it ("View Schema Diagram", "View
  Relationships") were always shown in English. They now use the Spanish,
  Korean, and Simplified Chinese catalogs. Audit log summaries stay in English,
  like every other audit event.

* **Ayu colors on buttons and checkboxes** — primary buttons such as Save and
  checked checkboxes now use the selected theme's amber accent instead of the
  component library's default white fill. Component colors, including hover and
  pressed states, stay aligned when switching between Dark, Mirage, and Light.

* **The command palette accepts every letter while typing a search** — the palette
  layer bound bare `s`, `j` and `k` to commands, so the workspace keydown handler
  consumed those keystrokes before the search input saw them. All unmodified
  letters now reach the input; list navigation stays on the arrow keys, with
  Enter to run and Escape to close unchanged.

* **AWS login and SSO wizard labels** — the login modal captioned the
  verification URL as "Start URL"; it now reads "Verification URL" and shows a
  loading indicator while it waits for the browser. The SSO wizard's first-step
  inputs now have visible labels, which are also their accessible names, and
  stable `sso-field-*` ids. Its steps appear in the shared wizard rail instead
  of "Step N:" text, and long account and role lists scroll inside a
  fixed-height box, so the Back and Next buttons stay in view.

* **Composite foreign keys keep the constraint's own column order** — the referenced
  columns came from a join between two catalog views that matched the constraint as a
  set rather than by position, so a key spanning more than one column kept its pairing
  only by accident of the order the catalog happened to return. The single-table view
  and the whole-schema view now read the constraint's own column arrays in order.

* **Enum columns whose type is outside `search_path` offer their values again** —
  the type name a column reports is schema-qualified when its type is not on the
  search path, while the lookup for the enum's labels used the bare type name, so
  the two never matched and the grid fell back to free text instead of the value
  dropdown.

* **A partitioned table keeps its indexes in the sidebar and in comparisons** —
  the bulk index query selected only ordinary tables, but a partitioned table is
  its own relation kind while still carrying entries in the index catalog, so the
  parent lost its indexes while every partition kept theirs. The one-table path
  never filtered, which is why the two disagreed; both agree now.

* **Left-Right now flows left to right on cyclic schemas** — the layered layout only
  handled acyclic graphs, so a schema where two tables reference each other (the
  common case) silently fell back to a grid and the Left-Right choice made no
  difference. Layers are assigned on the graph's strongly connected components now,
  and the tables inside each layer are ordered to reduce crossings.

* **A running import can be cancelled** — the import wizard's running step
  had no Cancel button, while export and migration did. Cancel now stops the
  import after the chunk being written, ends its Tasks panel entry as
  cancelled rather than failed, and reports how many rows were already
  imported. The import's row counter now also advances while it runs, import
  and export show the migration wizard's progress bar when the row total is
  known, and the three data wizards open at the same size.

* **Switching diagram layouts no longer panics** — two tables closer together than
  the gap the edge anchors need — dragged by hand, or placed by the radial layout —
  produced an inverted corridor that made the routing clamp panic.

* **Single-line completion fields keep their text on the row** — the DataView
  `WHERE` filter and the query builder's row inputs (filter, sort, group by,
  join, projected columns) moved to a code-editor widget in the gpui-pre
  migration, and its frame adds code-editor padding inside the 24 px row. The
  placeholder and value were pushed onto the field's bottom edge and clipped
  by its border; they are centered again.

* **Resized data-grid columns survive a sort or refresh** — column widths,
  selection, and scroll position were discarded by every reload (header sort,
  pagination, filter, manual and auto refresh) because the grid state was
  rebuilt from scratch each time. A reload now updates the existing table
  state, so a width follows its column even when the result is reordered or
  re-projected; the cursor is dropped only when the rows themselves are a
  different set (another page, another filter or page size), and the sort
  indicator no longer claims an order the new rows do not have.

* **Closing an empty script no longer waits on its own file** — the close that
  removes an emptied script's backing file used to read the whole file, then
  delete it and rescan the scripts directory, all on the UI thread, so a slow
  or stalled volume froze the window for as long as it took to answer. Those
  three steps now run off the UI thread, and the cleanup still fails closed: a
  file another process wrote into is left alone.

* **Remaining English-only labels are translated** — the command palette
  footer and its "no saved charts" warning, the key-value encoding picker and
  size labels, the audit viewer's filter options, time zone, placeholders and
  row range, the time-range "Custom…" picker, the visual query builder section
  titles, the theme, audit log level and MCP client badges in Settings, the
  object preview's text kind, and the MCP approvals requester and actor lines
  now follow the selected language. SQL keywords in section titles keep their
  SQL spelling. The palette footer no longer advertises an "open in new tab"
  shortcut that did nothing.

* **Closing an untitled buffer asks before it drops the edits** — a buffer
  with no file yet (a new query before its first save, or a restored scratch
  buffer) could only be closed by completing Save As, so dismissing that
  dialog left the tab open with no way out. Every close route now asks first:
  save it, close it without saving, or cancel. "Don't save" removes the tab
  without saving the edits, matching every other document.

* **A refused save before closing says what failed** — closing a tab or
  quitting with edits that could not reach their file reported "Auto-save
  failed", the message for a background autosave the user never asked for. A
  refused close now says the tab stayed open, a refused quit says the edits
  stayed in the session, and both point at `Ctrl+s` / **Save File As** as the
  deliberate overwrite. A file with no trustworthy baseline therefore no
  longer leaves its tab impossible to close without that hint.

* **Confirm modals are keyboard-accessible** — Enter now confirms and
  Escape cancels every confirm dialog (multi-statement script
  confirmation, dangerous query, and any other modal on the shared
  `ConfirmModal` keymap context), and focus moves off the SQL editor
  while a confirmation is open, so typing no longer edits the buffer
  behind it. Focus returns to the editor when the dialog closes; the
  script-confirm Run button is highlighted as the primary action.

* **"Save" on tab close waits for the save to land** — a tab whose close
  opened the unsaved-changes dialog now closes only after the write
  actually succeeded. Dismissing Save As, a failed write, or edits made
  while the write was in flight keep the tab open with its changes
  instead of closing over unsaved work; a document that has no save path
  at all keeps its tab too and says so. "Don't save" discards only the
  documents the dialog listed, not every open tab.

* **Modals answer Enter, Escape and close the same way** — only the delete
  connection and unsaved changes dialogs answered the keyboard, and most
  dialogs had no close button and ignored clicks on the backdrop. Every dialog
  built on the shared modal shell now cancels on Escape, the X button and a
  backdrop click, and confirms on Enter only while its primary action is
  enabled; Enter inside a multi-line editor still inserts a new line. The drop
  table and tunnel passphrase dialogs focus their input when they open, the
  drop table and unsaved changes dialogs use real disabled buttons, and the
  unsaved changes list uses the standard checkbox. The drop table SQL preview
  now quotes the table the way the connection's database does, such as
  backticks on MySQL and brackets on SQL Server, instead of always using
  PostgreSQL double quotes. The cell editor and document preview have their
  own keyboard contexts, and Escape closes them.

* **The remaining dialogs answer Enter, Escape and close too** — the dashboard
  and saved chart dialogs (new dashboard, rename, delete, add panel), the
  connection import and export dialogs, the script and dangerous query
  confirmations, the chart Configure popover and the sidebar's delete
  confirmation for folders, scripts, views and multi-selections ignored the
  keyboard or had no close on the backdrop. They now take focus when they
  open, cancel on Escape, the X button and a backdrop click, confirm on Enter
  only while their primary action is enabled, and give focus back when they
  close. New dashboard and rename need a non-blank name, and their Create and
  Rename buttons are now disabled until then; add panel needs a complete tab,
  the import and export dialogs follow their primary button, and Enter in the
  Configure popover applies. While an import or export runs, Escape, the
  backdrop and Cancel do nothing, since the run cannot be stopped.

* **Password save failures are reported** — a failed keyring write while
  saving or duplicating a connection profile now keeps the form open and
  shows the error instead of silently committing a profile with no secret.

* **An unresponsive system keyring no longer freezes the app** — every
  keyring call now runs on its own thread under a five-second bound, so a
  secret service that never answers (a locked keyring whose unlock prompt
  is never answered, competing providers on `org.freedesktop.secrets`, a
  stuck D-Bus session) reports a timeout instead of blocking the caller —
  the UI thread on the connection save and duplicate paths — forever. After
  a failed *write* DBFlux stops writing for five seconds, so a burst of
  clicks on Save fails immediately instead of paying the bound again and
  leaving another worker behind, and picks writes back up on its own once
  that passes; stored passwords stay readable throughout.

* **MongoDB multi-statement JavaScript script execution** — a buffer that
  does not parse as a single `db.` call or JSON query now runs as a
  mongosh-style script in a sandboxed QuickJS engine, executing every
  statement in source order and reporting a distinct result per statement.
  `find()`/`aggregate()` return a real bounded JS `Array` (`.forEach`,
  `for...of`, `.map`, `.length`, `.toArray()`) capped at 10 000 documents
  with an explicit error on overflow instead of silent truncation, and
  `print()` output is captured alongside the results. Every dispatched
  operation is classified from the constructed operation itself, not from
  source text, so a computed method name or an operation reached only
  inside a loop or conditional is still classified correctly; a script that
  cannot be proven read-only requires one up-front confirmation, and any
  operation exceeding the confirmed ceiling aborts before it reaches the
  server. Each dispatched operation gets its own audit row sharing one
  correlation id. Along the way, MCP/AI-client governance classification of
  MongoDB queries now delegates to the driver's own `LanguageService`
  instead of a core text heuristic — source-text classification cannot see
  past a computed method name or a conditionally-reached operation, which
  dispatch-boundary classification fixes for both scripts and MCP-driven
  execution.

* **A reopened table keeps its grid editable** — the primary key was read from
  the connection's table-details cache under a different database key than the
  one the fetch wrote it under, so only the first open of a table after
  connecting had the inline editor and every later open showed the "no primary
  key" banner until the profile was reconnected. Every reader now builds the
  key the fetch writes with, and details that are already cached are used
  instead of being fetched again. A table whose keys were still unknown when
  its first page loaded is re-queried ordered by those keys, so paging a large
  table no longer repeats or skips rows, and a table-details fetch that cannot
  start reports the failure instead of leaving the grid read-only.

* **An inline edit can be taken back by typing the row's own value** — the
  typed value was compared with the value the row already holds and, on a
  match, an earlier pending change was neither replaced nor dropped: the cell
  kept showing the edit, the row stayed marked as modified, and applying the
  changes wrote the discarded value. Typing the row's own value now drops the
  pending change, the cell and the row go back to clean, and the drop is
  undoable. The enum dropdown, the value panel, "Set NULL", "Set default" and
  paste go through the same path, and paste writes to the row the grid shows
  when a pending insert sits above the selection instead of one row below it.

### Changed

* **Schema metadata is loaded in bulk** — the schema diagram asked the database for
  one table at a time, five queries per table (columns, enum values, indexes,
  foreign keys and constraints), so a sixteen-table schema cost about eighty-five
  sequential round trips and the whole-database diagram, which loads up to a
  hundred tables, could reach roughly five hundred. Metadata is now read once per
  schema and assembled in memory, which brings the same schema to about eleven
  queries and stops the cost from growing with the number of tables. A driver with
  no bulk path still loads one table at a time. The constraint and foreign-key
  introspection also reads the catalog directly now instead of the standard
  information views, which are four-way joins with privilege checks.

* **A diagram warms the sidebar's index and foreign-key folders** — the metadata a
  diagram reads in bulk is handed to the connection's caches, so expanding those
  folders afterwards shows them instead of fetching what the diagram already had. A
  seam that failed leaves its cache empty rather than filling it with a stand-in.

* **Coupled schemas keep their depth** — when tables reference each other in a ring,
  the diagram no longer draws them as one tall column: the cycle is cut open and every
  table keeps the depth its dependencies suggest. The router also steps an edge lane
  around a table that ends up standing in a corridor, and column rows reserve less
  space, so a table takes less width (`timestamp with time zone` is shown as
  `timesta…`, which still identifies it).

* **The schema diagram is laid out to be read** — tables now keep real space
  between them, and the layered view no longer packs a wide table into the next
  column. Foreign keys are drawn as straight orthogonal paths that travel in the
  gaps between tables instead of curves crossing the canvas, and each end carries
  a crow's foot on the table that declares the key and a tick on the table it
  references, so direction no longer has to be traced through a line. Dragged
  tables snap to the background grid, and the toolbar gained **Arrange** — clear
  the manual positions and recompute the layout — and **Fit**, which zooms the
  whole diagram into view.

* **Loading a schema shows the shape of what is coming** — the diagram panel used
  to show a spinner and a label in an otherwise empty canvas; it now shows a grid
  of placeholder tables while the metadata loads, and the spinner animates.

* **Language list derived from the translation catalogs (#360)** — the
  Settings language dropdown now lists every language that ships a catalog in
  `crates/dbflux_i18n/locales/`, with each language named in its own tongue
  via the `language.native_name` key. Contributing a new language on Weblate
  is enough for it to appear in the next build, with no code changes.

### Added

* **Complete Spanish documentation and a language menu (#360)** — the
  website's language switcher is now a dropdown listing every supported
  language, ready to grow beyond two; the docs links in the navigation and
  footer keep the reader's language across hosts. Every document the site
  serves now ships in Spanish: the remaining fourteen guides, the
  architecture and contributing pages, and all thirteen driver READMEs
  (served from `docs/es/drivers/`).

* **Spanish website and documentation (#360)** — dbflux.dev gains a Spanish
  edition under `/es/`: the landing page, about page, navigation, search
  dialog, install tabs and footer read from typed dictionaries with a
  language switcher in the nav; every documentation page exists under
  `/es/docs/…` per version, rendering the Spanish translation when a
  `docs/es/<NAME>.md` sibling exists and the English page with a visible
  "not yet translated" notice (and `noindex`) when it does not. The install,
  usage and connections guides ship translated. Search engines get
  reciprocal `hreflang` pairs, per-locale canonicals and localized sitemap
  entries. Along the way two long-standing link bugs were fixed: relative
  markdown links in the published docs resolved against the wrong root
  (broken GitHub URLs), and links between version-exclusive pages crossed
  into the wrong version.

* **Spanish user interface (#360)** — Settings → General gains a Language
  control with System, English, and Spanish. System follows the OS locale
  and falls back to English when that locale is not supported; the choice
  is persisted and applied on the next start, and the control shows a
  permanent note saying so. The whole application is translated: shared
  components and modals, the connections and scripts sidebar, the command
  palette, every document type (data grid and its context menus, query
  builder, code editor and scripts, key-value, audit viewer, schema diff,
  charts and dashboards, object browser and editor, buckets table, the
  import, export and migrate wizards), the workspace shell (status bar,
  tasks panel, shutdown overlay, login modal, toasts), the settings window
  (general, keybindings, hooks, auth profiles, drivers, MCP, audit, RPC
  services, SSH tunnels, proxies) and the connection manager (all tabs,
  import panel, export modal). Database and protocol vocabulary (query,
  schema, WHERE, SQL, JSON, CSV, driver names, AWS terms, statistic
  names, key chords) stays in English inside Spanish text; persisted
  names and audit records are never translated. The catalogs live in
  `crates/dbflux_i18n/locales/{en,es}.yml`, one file per locale, and are
  managed through Weblate.

### Fixed

* **Honest errors for MongoDB input that is not a single query (#587)** — the
  Mongo editor accepts one `db.collection.method(...)` call or a JSON query,
  and it now says so. Pasting a `mongosh` script used to fail with
  `Invalid JSON: expected value at line 1 column 1`, blaming JSON for input
  that was never JSON; it now reports that scripts are not supported yet.
  Two silent failures are gone with it: a script whose first statement was a
  `db.` call ran that one statement and discarded the rest, and a chained
  call such as `db.users.find({}).limit(5)` ran the `find` and dropped the
  `.limit(5)`, returning more rows than asked for. Both are now refused, the
  chained case naming the method it cannot honour.

* **Several MCP clients per connection (#542)** — the Connection Manager MCP
  tab is now a master-detail view: a filterable list of every trusted client
  on the left, and on the right whether the selected client may use this
  connection, its roles and policies, and a preview of the tools and
  classifications those grant. Previously the tab could bind a single client,
  and saving a connection silently dropped every other binding it held.

* **Keyboard navigation in Settings lists and forms (#543)** — MCP Clients,
  Roles and Policies can now be browsed, created and edited from the keyboard:
  `l`/`enter` opens the form, `n` starts a new item, `j`/`k` and `tab` move
  between fields with a visible focus ring, `enter` activates a field and
  `h`/`escape` return to the list. Built-in roles and policies stay read-only
  under the keyboard cursor. Hooks shows the focus ring on every form field,
  so the cursor moved by `j`/`k` is no longer invisible. `n` creates a new
  item in Proxies, SSH Tunnels and Services as well, and the Audit status
  indicator is no longer a keyboard stop. The MCP sections render their list
  through a new reusable master-detail composite.

* **Editing a cell and clicking another one lost the typed value (#539)** —
  the inline editor closed through the input's blur event, which discarded
  the edit buffer. Selecting or shift-selecting another cell now commits the
  edit in progress, as Enter does, and the value survives as a pending
  change; blur remains a fallback for focus leaving the grid entirely.

* **Save Row shortcuts stopped working after an inline edit** — closing an
  inline editor unmounted the focused element and left the window with no
  focus, so every shortcut bound to the results grid went inert until the
  next click: Cmd/Ctrl+Enter for Save Row, Cmd/Ctrl+A, the arrow keys and
  the vim aliases. Closing an editor now returns focus to the grid.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

* **Amazon S3 driver (DBF-26)** — A first-party object-storage driver for AWS
  S3 and S3-compatible endpoints. The connection root shows a buckets table
  (name, region, object count, size, versioning, created); the sidebar lists
  buckets flat, one level deep. The object browser follows AWS-console-style
  per-level pagination by default, with an optional lazy tree mode for full
  expansion. The preview pane renders images and SVGs natively, opens
  text-like objects (txt, md, json, csv, log, ...) in an inline editor with
  dirty tracking and Ctrl+S save-back, and falls back to metadata plus
  download/open-externally for PDF and other binary objects; preview size is
  capped at a configurable 10 MiB, and archived storage classes (GLACIER,
  DEEP_ARCHIVE) never fetch a body. Full object CRUD covers upload, delete,
  type-to-confirm recursive prefix/bucket delete batched in groups of 1000,
  folder and bucket creation with per-endpoint option degradation, rename via
  copy-then-delete, and presigned URLs. A full editor tab with an in-editor
  find panel, a resizable object-details pane, and a row context menu round
  out the browsing experience. Authentication supports AWS profiles/SSO or
  static credentials, with custom endpoints for Cloudflare R2, MinIO, and
  path-style addressing. Every mutation is audited under a new object-storage
  event category, and a MinIO-backed live integration suite runs in CI.
  Deferred: multipart upload with a transfers panel, and an embedded PDF
  viewer.

* **Amazon Redshift driver (read-only) (DBF-23)** — A first-party Redshift
  connection for browsing and querying analytical warehouses. Connect over the
  PostgreSQL wire protocol (host, port `5439`, database, user, password; TLS
  with optional custom root CA and client-certificate mTLS; optional SSH
  tunnel), browse schemas, tables, views, and columns, and run read-only
  `SELECT` queries. Table details surface Redshift-specific distribution and
  sort keys plus advisory (non-enforced) primary/foreign/unique constraints as
  storage hints, shown through a generic sidebar seam that any driver can
  populate. `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` values are decoded from the binary wire format.
  This first release is read-only: `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, inline editing,
  and multi-statement input are rejected with a clear error; IAM/SSO auth,
  `COPY`/`UNLOAD`, and query-plan visualization are not yet supported.
  
* **Context-aware SQL autocomplete in the query editor** — Completion in the
  SQL editor now follows where the cursor sits instead of listing every
  identifier the connection knows: tables and views after `FROM`/`JOIN`,
  columns scoped to the tables actually referenced in the statement, relation
  aliases, CTE names, and `SELECT` output aliases in `GROUP BY` / `ORDER BY` /
  `HAVING`. It parses with tree-sitter so it holds up on half-typed queries,
  prefetches column metadata in the background so a table no longer needs a
  sidebar expand first, and hydrates from the latest deep schema snapshot on
  connect so it starts warm after a restart. Every relational driver benefits;
  non-SQL dialects keep their existing keyword completion.

* **Data transfer — Export, Import, and same-engine Migration for SQL databases** —
  A new transfer engine moves SQL data without leaving DBFlux. Multi-select
  tables in the sidebar and **Export** them to a folder (one CSV or JSON file
  per table plus a `manifest.json` that makes the bundle re-importable),
  **Import** a previously exported bundle into a connected database, or
  **Migrate** tables directly from one connection to another through a guided,
  multi-phase wizard — pick the source tables and the target database from a
  connection → database → schema → table tree, review the mapping in a
  Source / Target / Mapping / Transform grid, and move through Options,
  Confirm, and Run steps tracked in a phase sidebar, in a larger centered
  modal. Migration orders
  tables by foreign-key dependencies (parents before children), with a manual
  reorder step when the graph has cycles and an optional
  disable-referential-integrity toggle during transfer. Target tables can be
  auto-created from the source schema (Create / Use existing / Recreate / Skip),
  columns auto-map by name with adjustable overrides, and destructive modes
  (Recreate, Truncate) require explicit confirmation. This first release covers
  same-engine SQL transfers (PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, SQL Server);
  cross-engine and NoSQL migration are not yet supported.

* **Export / import standalone profiles from Settings (#214)** — SSH tunnels,
  proxies, and auth profiles can now be exported and imported directly from
  their Settings sections, building on the connection portability pipeline
  (#213). Each profile editor gains an **Export** action in its footer
  (keyboard-navigable alongside Save / Delete) that opens the same
  passphrase-encrypted TOML bundle modal, scoped to that single profile; each
  section's list header gains an **Import…** action (also reachable with `i`
  when the profile list is focused) that opens the import wizard with its
  conflict / required-reference resolution. The import wizard now presents as a
  modal dialog with the same chrome as the export modal — in Settings and in the
  Connection Manager alike — so export and import look and behave consistently.
  AWS reflected auth profiles stay reference-only and cannot be exported. Secret
  material travels only inside the encrypted secrets section, passphrase
  encryption is on by default, and the bundle format is unchanged.

* **Export / import connection profiles as a portable bundle (#212)** —
  Connection profiles can be exported to a single passphrase-encrypted TOML
  bundle and imported on another machine, with a wizard that resolves name
  conflicts and required references. A driver seam (`ExportFieldHint`) decides
  per field what travels: regular values are included, passwords and
  write-only fields go into the encrypted secrets section, local file paths are
  flagged as machine-local, and environment-local references (AWS named
  profiles, auth-profile references) are marked required-on-import so the user
  supplies them on the target machine.

* **Schema diff & apply (DBF-24)** — A schema-drift comparison now works at the
  table-set level, not just per table: added, removed, and modified tables are
  detected by `(schema, name)` identity, and each individual change (column
  added/removed/renamed, type or default changed, index added/removed,
  constraint added/removed, primary-key changed) is annotated with its
  governance risk through the same classifier the MCP layer uses, so risky
  operations are labelled consistently everywhere. The drift modal renders the
  new change kinds and the resulting migration can be applied from the UI.

* **Cross-driver query tooling — PartiQL editor and Document-driver builder** —
  The query editor and visual builder are no longer SQL-only. A new
  `EditorLanguageProfile` seam on `DriverMetadata` drives highlighting,
  placeholder, comment prefix, connection-context controls, and live
  diagnostics from driver metadata instead of the query language enum, and the
  builder now opens for any driver whose capabilities support it, sourcing its
  sections and operators from `QueryCapabilities`. In practice this gives
  DynamoDB a full PartiQL surface — SQL-style highlighting, context-aware
  autocomplete over the table and its sampled attributes, `SELECT` reads and
  governed writes through `ExecuteStatement`, and sort-key-only ordering — and
  gives MongoDB read generation from the visual builder. No-`WHERE` PartiQL
  `DELETE`/`UPDATE` is flagged as dangerous through the shared classifier.
  Relational drivers are unchanged.

* **Per-channel app icon and identity (#183)** — Nightly builds now ship their
  own brand mark, application id (`dbflux-nightly`), window title, desktop and
  MIME entries, and database file, so a nightly install coexists with a stable
  one instead of sharing its taskbar entry and data. The channel is derived
  once from the compiled version, and nightly can opt into sharing the stable
  database from Settings. macOS and Windows move onto the same design-system
  mark as Linux; stable packaging output is byte-identical to before.

### Fixed

* **Standalone MCP server failed to start and listed no tools** — The
  governance binding role/policy repositories queried table names that did not
  match the migrated schema, so `dbflux mcp` aborted with "no such table" for
  any profile with a governance binding (the same mismatch also broke saving
  these bindings in the main app). Startup then panicked on a blocking lock
  read inside the async runtime, and `tools/list` returned an empty catalog
  because the tool handler served an empty router instead of the combined one.

* **SSH tunnel / proxy list icon vanishing on long hosts** — The globe icon in
  the Settings SSH tunnels and proxies lists could be squeezed to zero width by
  long, unbreakable hostnames (e.g. EC2 `ec2-…compute.amazonaws.com` addresses),
  so some rows appeared to have no icon. The icon container is now
  `flex_shrink_0` and the text column `min_w_0`, so the icon always renders and
  the subtitle truncates instead.

* **Shutdown left connections and background work dangling** — `SIGINT` and
  `SIGTERM` now run the same graceful shutdown path as closing the window, so
  connections, hooks, and background tasks are torn down instead of being
  killed mid-flight.

* **Connection hooks were dropped when a profile was saved** — Editing a
  profile could discard its hook bindings, and the hook "test" run did not
  execute the configured phases. Both are fixed, and hook phases run as
  configured.

* **Duplicate Settings windows** — Closing and reopening Settings could leave a
  second window behind; only one Settings window can now exist at a time.

* **Sidebar context menus escaped the window and drifted** — Context menus and
  their submenus are now anchored to the owning row instead of trailing the
  cursor, and are repositioned to stay on-screen near window edges.

* **Single-database connections lost their lazy nodes** — Sidebar refresh could
  collapse a lazily loaded single-database node and drop its children.

* **MySQL / MariaDB panicked when connecting over TLS (#291)** — SSL
  connections aborted the process instead of returning an error.

* **Main window did not come to the front on a second launch** — An IPC focus
  request now activates and raises the existing window.

* **Inline table editing discarded typed text** — Text typed into an inline
  cell editor could be reset before commit.

* **Audit CSV export was not RFC 4180-safe** — Text columns are now escaped
  correctly, so exports containing quotes, commas, or newlines round-trip
  losslessly.

* **Settings number inputs collapsed on first layout** — General settings
  number fields are laid out in a flex row with a definite width, so they no
  longer render zero-width until the first resize.

* **MCP governance, audit, and DDL integrity hardening (MCP-1..6)** — Fixes
  across policy evaluation, audit persistence, and DDL classification in the
  MCP governance stack.

* **Security and reliability hardening (SEC2-3..5, MISC-1..15)** — MySQL hex
  literal handling, storage file permissions, `process.run` PATH visibility,
  atomic migration bootstrap, non-panicking `SystemTime` use, and bounded IPC
  reads, plus assorted reliability fixes.

* **Packaging and CI** — The nightly binary build resolves brand-mark
  locations correctly, `dbflux-nightly` is exposed through the Nix overlay with
  a stamped build version, nightly release notes are scoped to commits since
  the previous nightly, and stale nightly assets are pruned.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

* **Visual UPDATE / DELETE query builder (#163)** — The
  `QueryBuilderPanel` gains a mode selector that extends the visual SELECT
  builder with UPDATE and DELETE modes, reusing the relational filter bar
  for `WHERE` composition. The SQL preview is always visible and
  regenerates synchronously on every builder change. New core types
  (`VisualMutationSpec`, `MutationKind`, `ColumnAssignment`,
  `AssignmentValue`) feed `QueryGenerator::generate_update_from_spec` /
  `generate_delete_from_spec`, which emit keyset-paginated chunked DML for
  all four SQL dialects; a raw-expression assignment is tracked via a
  `used_raw_expression` flag rather than a textual marker. Execution runs
  through a `MutationExecutor` state machine with three modes —
  `SingleTransaction`, `ChunkedTransaction`, `DirectAutocommit` —
  auto-suggested from the count estimate, the `TRANSACTIONS` capability,
  and primary-key availability, with a tradeoff modal on user override.
  Chunked runs use keyset pagination over the table PK (chunk size
  clamped to `[1000, 10000]`, default 5000), surface per-chunk entries in
  the Tasks panel with cancellation between chunks, and `ROLLBACK` on
  chunk failure. No-`WHERE` UPDATE/DELETE is gated by a doubled
  spec-level + text-level `DangerousQueryKind` check, and a new
  `MutationPolicy` seam (`Allowed` / `ReadOnly` / `ApprovalRequired`)
  composes MCP-actor, per-profile read-only, and default resolution.
  Driver-agnostic by construction: gated on `QueryLanguage::Sql` with no
  per-driver branching.

* **Inline edit on builder-generated SELECT results (#170)** — Inline
  cell edit and row delete now work on results produced by the visual
  query builder, not just plain table browses, when the result is
  provably *editable-safe*: it maps 1:1 to a single underlying table
  and every primary-key column of that table is projected under its
  original name. The builder computes an `EditableBinding` from the
  committed `VisualQuerySpec` and threads it into the DataView, so edits
  and deletes reuse the existing single-table mutation path with a
  `WHERE` built from the projected PK values — no parsing of the
  generated SQL. JOINs are allowed: columns originating from the source
  table are editable while joined columns are marked read-only. The
  result falls back to read-only — with a toolbar hint explaining why —
  when any rule fails: aggregates / `GROUP BY` / `HAVING`, a wildcard
  projection across a JOIN, a primary key that is missing or projected
  under an alias, or a schema cache that has not yet loaded the table's
  keys (the grid upgrades to editable on its own once the keys arrive).
  Free-form editor SQL stays read-only; this is scoped to builder-
  generated queries. Driver-agnostic by construction: the editable-safe
  proof lives in `dbflux_core` over generic spec and metadata types with
  no per-driver branching, so every relational driver picks it up.

* **GROUP BY and aggregates in the visual query builder (#161)** — The
  visual SELECT builder gains a `Group By / Aggregates` section between
  Joins and Sort, with a separate `Having` section that reuses the same
  predicate editor as `Filters` (WHERE). Supported aggregate functions:
  `COUNT`, `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`,
  each with an editable alias that auto-generates from the function and
  column. When the spec becomes grouped, the projection section is
  replaced by a read-only effective `SELECT` preview composed of group
  columns followed by aggregate aliases; sort entries are restricted to
  group columns and aggregate aliases, with invalid entries rejected
  with a visible error. The DataView reshapes in place: rows reflect
  the aggregated result, pagination switches to a `COUNT(*)` subquery
  over the grouped SELECT so the total page count is accurate, and
  aggregate result columns receive the correct `ColumnKind` so chart
  auto-detection keeps working (`COUNT*` → Integer, `AVG` → Float,
  `SUM` preserves Integer/Float, `MIN`/`MAX` preserve input). Editing
  is gated when the result is aggregated: add-row, delete-row,
  edit-cell, and inspect-row become unavailable with explanatory
  tooltips, and the footer surfaces a count of incomplete aggregate
  rows so silently-dropped rows are visible to the user. Driver-
  agnostic by construction: gated on `QueryLanguage::Sql` with no
  per-driver branching, and the existing `SqlSelectBuilder` is extended
  with `build_group_by`, `build_having`, and `build_count_of_grouped`
  shared across SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and SQL Server.

* **Schema-aware autocomplete for the visual query builder and DataView
  filter (#165)** — Inline suggestion popovers now appear on the
  builder rail's single-line inputs (filter / sort / projected columns,
  join target table, join `ON` left and right sides) and on the
  DataView toolbar's WHERE filter input. Suggestions are sourced from
  the live schema and the builder's own spec — source-table columns,
  declared join aliases (`alias.column`), and joined-table columns
  fetched lazily through the existing background metadata pattern.
  After typing `<alias>.`, results are scoped to that alias's columns
  only. Arrow keys navigate, `Tab` / `Enter` commits, `Esc` and focus
  loss dismiss. Prefix-only filtering for now (substring and SQL
  keyword completion are deliberately deferred). Driver-agnostic by
  construction: suggestions consume `dbflux_core` metadata types
  without branching on driver id, so every relational driver picks the
  feature up automatically.

* **Relational filters in the DataView filter bar (#162)** — The filter
  bar now accepts ORM-style dotted paths like
  `created_by.email LIKE '%@acme.com'` or
  `created_by.organization.name = 'Acme'`. Paths are resolved against
  foreign-key metadata cached on the data grid; the resolver lowers the
  expression into a `VisualQuerySpec` with `JoinOn::FkPath` joins and
  routes it through the same builder pipeline that ships with the
  visual SELECT builder (#146), so there is no second SQL generation
  path. Ambiguous segments surface an inline chip with an "Open in
  builder" action seeded with the joins resolved so far. The feature is
  driver-agnostic and gated on `QueryLanguage::Sql`; non-dotted input
  keeps today's raw-WHERE behavior.

* **Visual SELECT query builder (#146)** — A right-rail query builder
  composes SELECT statements without writing SQL: projection, FROM with
  alias, JOINs, a recursive `WHERE` predicate tree, `ORDER BY`, and
  `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`, with a live parameterized SQL preview. The foundation
  is the new `VisualQuerySpec` (and supporting `FilterNode`, `Predicate`,
  `JoinStep`, `JoinOn`, `Projection`, `SortEntry` types) in
  `dbflux_core`, rendered by `SqlSelectBuilder` behind the defaulted
  `QueryGenerator::generate_select` trait method with dialect-specific
  placeholders for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and SQL Server.
  Builders can be saved and reopened: migration 017 adds `qry_saved_queries`
  and its child tables (columns, sorts, joins) with cascading FKs and a
  `UNIQUE (profile_id, name)` constraint, fronted by `SavedQueryRepo` and
  an in-memory `SavedQueryManager`. A `TableProbe` seam verifies table
  existence when importing a saved query onto another connection without
  reaching into driver code. A `column_kind` inference fallback maps
  `type_name` to `ColumnKind` so charts keep working on builder results.
  Driver-agnostic by construction: gated on `QueryLanguage::Sql`.

* **Instance metrics charts and inspectors across drivers (#93)** —
  PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, and SQL Server now expose
  live server metrics (time series) and tabular inspectors (sessions,
  processlist, currentOp, CLIENT LIST) through a new `InstanceCatalog`
  driver seam and two capability flags: `INSTANCE_METRICS` and
  `INSTANCE_INSPECTOR`. Each catalog publishes a driver-defined
  **Instance Overview** dashboard that opens read-only and can be
  cloned via "Save as editable" into a persisted, user-owned dashboard.
  Dashboards gain a new `Inspector` panel kind alongside `Chart` and
  `Divider`, persisted via `viz_dashboard_panels.panel_kind`
  (migration 014). Inspector rows expose driver-supplied row actions
  (e.g. *Terminate connection* / *Kill session*) gated by per-driver
  privilege probes (`pg_monitor`, `PROCESS` / `CONNECTION_ADMIN`,
  MongoDB `killOp`, Redis `CLIENT KILL`). Destructive actions route
  through `report_error_async` so failures land in the audit log with a
  correlation id, and every refresh timer (dashboard, chart, inspector)
  skips its tick when the underlying connection is gone so closing a
  connection no longer floods the toast layer.
* **External RPC drivers and auth providers can emit audit events (#157)**
  RPC-backed drivers (driver protocol v1.2, capability `AuditEmit`) and
  auth providers (auth-provider protocol v1.3, hello flag
  `audit_emit_opt_in`) can now write to the audit log over IPC by sending
  `EmitAuditEvent` frames as intermediate `done=false` responses. The host
  sanitizes every event: forces `actor_type`/`source_id` to new
  `ExternalDriver` / `ExternalAuthProvider` variants, fills `actor_id`
  with the registered RPC service ID, overrides connection context from
  `AppState`, enforces a per-source category whitelist (drivers:
  `Connection`/`Query`/`System`; auth providers: `Connection` only), and
  truncates `details_json` to the configured `max_detail_bytes`. A
  per-`socket_id` token-bucket rate limiter (100 events/minute, configurable)
  caps emission; overflow events are dropped silently — the IPC session
  is never blocked or errored — and counted on
  `AuditService::external_audit_dropped`. Older RPC peers that don't
  advertise the capability/flag remain silent.
- Centralized user-facing error reporting (`report_error` / `report_error_async` in `dbflux_ui_base`). Failures across mutations, file save, settings, and workspace actions now surface as a styled toast with a "View in Audit" action, increment a status-bar error badge, and emit a tracing event correlated with the audit row (#156).
- `EventRecord.correlation_id` is now populated from the `correlation_id` tracing field across all `dbflux` targets, regardless of whether the field is recorded via `%` (Display) or `?` (Debug) sigil (#156).
- **Tracing-to-audit bridge for centralized log capture (#154)** — A new `tracing-bridge` feature installs an `AuditLayer` subscriber in the `dbflux`, `dbflux_mcp_server`, and `dbflux_driver_host` binaries that funnels `tracing` events into the audit log through a bounded background queue with an atomic drop counter and in-flight gauge. A configurable `log_capture_min_level` audit setting (default `info`, persisted via migration 014) gates capture and updates the shared level atomic immediately. The layer applies a recursion guard, level gate, and summary truncation, and `AuditService::dropped_log_event_count()` exposes overflow drops.

### Changed

- Toast host applies a severity-aware throttle (capacity 5, refill 1 token / 2 s) to Warning and Info toasts so connection-storm noise does not bury the UI; Error and Fatal toasts bypass the throttle (#156).
- **Provider-neutral auth-profile edit seam (#155)** — The auth-profile edit path no longer carries AWS-specific types in the public core API. `dbflux_core::auth::edit` now exposes a provider-neutral `AuthEditSnapshot` (opaque `Arc<dyn Any>`), `AuthEditTarget`, and `AuthSaveOutcome`; the former `AwsEditFile` / `AwsEditSnapshot` / `AwsSectionHash` types moved to a private `dbflux_aws::edit` module, and `AuthProviderCapabilities` gained an optional `edit` field (serde-defaulted for backward compatibility). All three AWS providers were rewired to the neutral types with no behavior change.

### Fixed

- **Scripts-tab folders can be collapsed again** — Chevron clicks were routed through the connections tree only, so script-folder expansion lookups always returned `false` and every click tried to expand. Toggling now routes through the active tab's tree, propagates the override into the scripts tree state, and applies expansion overrides when building script items so collapses survive a refresh.
- **Syntax highlighting preserved across `AppStateChanged`** — `CodeDocument` re-applied the highlighter mode on every `AppStateChanged`, and `InputState::set_highlighter` clears the cached highlighter until the next render — wiping SQL coloring after running a query until the next keystroke. The document now tracks the last applied `editor_mode` and only re-applies the highlighter when it actually changes.
- **NULL rendered as an empty field in CSV export** — CSV export emitted the PostgreSQL `\COPY` sentinel `\N` for NULL, which most CSV consumers (Excel, Sheets, generic parsers) read as the literal string. NULL now exports as an empty field, the de facto CSV convention.
- **Inactive tab background no longer mismatches the tab bar.**
- **Multiline UPDATE/DELETE no longer falsely flagged as missing a `WHERE`** — The dangerous-query check matched only the literal substring `" where "`, so a `WHERE` placed on its own line (preceded by a newline rather than a space) was never found and the statement was wrongly reported as affecting all rows. Detection now strips single-quoted string literals (honoring `''` escapes) and matches `where` as a whitespace/paren-delimited token, fixing the false positive for both UPDATE and DELETE while still catching `where` text that only appears inside a value.
- **Chart auto-detection across four drivers (#204)** — Drivers now assign `ColumnKind` honestly so the chart engine includes genuine numeric columns and excludes non-plottable ones. CloudWatch CWL Insights `@timestamp` / `@ingestionTime` values are normalised from CWLI format to RFC3339, and the kind scanner skips `Text` samples so mixed-type columns resolve correctly. DynamoDB infers kind from `AttributeValue`, MongoDB from BSON value types (BSON `Timestamp` stays `Unknown` — it carries no wall-clock meaning), and InfluxDB Flux/InfluxQL classify `boolean` as `Integer`. `Value::Bool` plots as 0/1 across all drivers, and `Value::DateTime` / `Value::Date` are extracted as epoch-milliseconds on a time axis. `Value::Time` has no absolute epoch, so SQL Server `TIME` columns are classified `Unknown` instead of being offered as an empty time axis.

## [0.6.0-dev.10] - 2026-05-29

### Added

* **Saved charts, dashboards, and CloudWatch dashboard browsing (#152)** —
  Charts created from query results can now be saved, organized into
  dashboards, and reopened from the sidebar. CloudWatch connections gain a
  browse view that lists the account's dashboards as a read-only catalog so
  they can be inspected without round-tripping through the AWS console.
  The change also lands the workspace's PaneHandle/ResultPanel refactor:
  document tabs share a single closure-erased shell and a universal chrome
  row built from `ToolbarSegment`s, so the mode bar, filter bar, and
  refresh dropdown wrap responsively on narrow windows instead of pushing
  controls off-screen.
* **AWS profiles reflected live from `~/.aws` as source of truth (#149)** —
  AWS SSO, SSO-session, and shared-credentials profiles are now enumerated
  on demand from `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` via mtime-guarded
  caches, with a deterministic UUIDv5 identity per `(provider_id, name)` so
  reflected profiles are stable across launches without ever being stored.
  DBFlux holds zero AWS key material on disk (ADR-7): the static-credentials
  provider and its write-back paths are gone, and all `~/.aws/config`
  writers now go through the atomic locked primitive so concurrent edits
  can no longer truncate the file. Reflected entries surface in the auth
  picker as read-only and are distinguished from stored profiles by a new
  `AuthProfile.read_only` flag.
* **AWS SSO sessions as first-class auth profiles** — A new `aws-sso-session`
  auth provider models the `[sso-session NAME]` block of `~/.aws/config` as
  its own profile, and `aws-sso` profiles reference it via a generic
  `FormFieldKind::AuthProfileRef` dropdown instead of duplicating
  `sso_start_url` / `sso_region` inline. A new `expand_auth_profile_refs`
  pass merges the referenced session's fields into consumers at pipeline-input
  and MCP-resolution time (consumer overrides win). Settings now renders the
  selected session as inert text via `disabled_when_field_set`, and the
  AWS-profile importer routes `[sso-session …]` blocks into the session
  provider so re-importing matches sessions by name. Account/role dropdowns
  always probe with a session marker, so they populate as soon as a valid
  SSO session exists without forcing a new login.
* **Copy-to-clipboard export from the data grid (#153)** — The data-grid
  export menu now offers *Copy to clipboard* alongside *Save as file* for
  every text-friendly format. Binary export is deliberately disabled with
  guidance to use Hex or Base64 instead.

### Changed

* **Single Settings window across all entry points** — The four entry points
  that opened Settings (workspace action, auth-profiles deep link, Connection
  Manager section jump, sidebar footer) now all funnel through a shared
  `open_or_focus_settings` helper. Previously only the workspace path used
  `AppState::settings_window` for dedup, so the other three could stack
  duplicate Settings windows on top of each other.

### Fixed

* **Native file dialog now has a fallback path with user feedback (#153)** —
  `rfd::AsyncFileDialog::save_file()` returns `None` on both user-cancel and
  backend-failure, so on Linux systems without `xdg-desktop-portal` /
  `zenity` / `kdialog` the data-grid export and script *Save As* silently
  dropped the action. DBFlux now pre-flights the backend via a PATH probe;
  when none is available it writes to `~/.local/share/dbflux/exports/` with
  a non-clobbering filename, raises a warning toast, and emits a
  `result_export_fallback` audit event. When a backend exists, `None` is
  treated as a genuine cancel. Script *Save As* mirrors the same pattern
  and now surfaces write failures via toast instead of a silent log line.
* **Schema drift modal no longer fires on every SELECT for multi-FK tables
  (#151)** — The MySQL/MariaDB and MSSQL drivers built their foreign-key
  list from a `HashMap`'s values, whose iteration order is nondeterministic.
  Drift compares cached vs fresh foreign keys positionally and hashes the
  fingerprint in order, so two identical fetches in a different order looked
  like a change. Both drivers now use `ForeignKeyBuilder::build_sorted()`,
  matching the order the SQL `ORDER BY` already specifies and the Postgres
  driver's behavior.
* **MariaDB and InfluxDB profiles default to the correct config variants**
  — `default_db_config_for_kind` fell through to `default_postgres()` for
  MariaDB and InfluxDB, so a profile loaded via this fallback got a Postgres
  config while keeping its real kind; saving then persisted the mismatch,
  and connecting failed with *"Expected MySQL configuration"* for MariaDB.
  MariaDB now maps to `default_mysql()` and InfluxDB to `default_influxdb()`;
  the catch-all arm is removed so new `DbKind` variants fail to compile
  instead of silently degrading to Postgres.
* **AWS SSO login no longer hangs after a successful browser flow** — The
  cache lookup that polled for the new SSO token relied on
  `sha1(start_url)` as the filename. AWS CLI v2 actually names the file
  `sha1(session_name)` whenever the profile uses an `sso_session` block, so
  the fast path silently returned an unrelated, expired file and the polling
  loop spun forever even after `aws sso login` printed *"Successfully logged
  into Start URL"*. `find_sso_cache_contents` now always scans the cache
  directory and picks the newest entry whose `startUrl` field matches,
  covering both the legacy URL-keyed and modern session-keyed schemes.
* **Inline SSO login panel replaces the cross-window modal** — The login
  panel, verification URL, *Open Browser* / *Copy URL* / *Cancel* buttons,
  and the new `abort_sso_login` plumbing now live inside the Auth Profiles
  settings section. Cancel actually kills the running `aws sso login` child
  process via a shared abort flag and a per-profile abort registry. The
  stdout scanner was also rewritten with a bounded `recv_timeout` loop so
  PKCE-flow URLs (which never print `user_code=`) are surfaced immediately
  instead of blocking indefinitely.

## [0.6.0-dev.9] - 2026-05-26

### Added

* **Metric picker rail tab for chart documents** — CloudWatch metric charts now
  open with an interactive picker rail (320 px overlay) that lets users browse
  namespaces, metrics, and dimension combinations fetched live via
  `ListMetrics` pagination. Selecting a metric and pressing Apply swaps the
  chart's data source and auto-runs the query. Results are cached for the
  session by `MetricCatalogCache`. No driver names or categories are hardcoded
  in the UI layer; the Metric tab is gated solely on the generic
  `METRIC_CATALOG` capability bit (#96).
* **Time-range macros for InfluxQL and Flux** — user-written InfluxDB queries
  can opt into UI-driven time-range substitution via Grafana-style tokens
  (`$timeFilter`, `$__from`, `$__to` for InfluxQL; `v.timeRangeStart`,
  `v.timeRangeStop` for Flux). Substitution happens at the execution
  chokepoint in both `CodeDocument` and `ChartDocument`; the InfluxDB driver's
  inject-when-absent path is skipped when macros are present so they take
  precedence without double-injection. Queries without macros keep today's
  byte-for-byte behavior. Documented in the driver README (#119).

### Changed

* **Driver-owned connection form definitions** — Built-in connection form
  schemas moved out of `dbflux_core` and into their owning driver crates.
  Core now keeps only the generic `DriverFormDef` primitives and helper
  builders, while the connection manager reads forms through the existing
  `DbDriver::form_definition()` seam. This removes driver-specific defaults,
  URI placeholders, tab layouts, and conditional field rules from core with
  no connection-manager behavior change (#140).
* **Dialect-specific language services leave core** — SQL Server's
  `TSqlLanguageService` now lives in `dbflux_driver_mssql`, matching the
  MongoDB and MySQL driver-owned language-service pattern. Core retains the
  generic `LanguageService` seam and shared SQL helpers, but no longer exports
  the T-SQL-specific implementation (#129).
* **MongoDB and Redis dangerous-query detection moved to drivers** — MongoDB
  and Redis dangerous-operation classifiers now live in their driver language
  services, and code execution asks the active connection's language service
  to classify dangerous queries. Core still owns the shared
  `DangerousQueryKind` type and SQL classifier, but no longer exports
  Mongo/Redis-specific detection helpers (#139).
* **Sidebar collapses single-database wrapper** — Connections whose driver
  exposes exactly one database (CloudWatch's `logs`, DynamoDB's default
  region, single-file SQLite, etc.) no longer render the redundant database
  level. Child nodes (Collections, Metrics, Tables) attach directly under the
  connection node. Multi-database drivers (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB) are
  unaffected — the wrapper still discriminates between databases (#131).
* **CloudWatch metric catalog hardening** — The `RealCloudWatchClient` adapter
  now reuses a single long-lived Tokio runtime across `list_metrics` calls
  (previously a new runtime was constructed per call, wasting file descriptors
  during full-namespace sweeps). The namespace sweep is also bounded at 50
  pages (~25,000 metrics) to cap the worst case on very large AWS accounts; the
  cap is documented in the driver README. A future change will replace the cap
  with full timeout + cancellation infrastructure (#96).
* **Sidebar metric leaves dedupe by metric name** — On accounts with
  per-instance metric explosion (e.g. AWS/EC2 with 1000 instances) the
  CloudWatch driver returns one `MetricDescriptor` per `(metric_name,
  dimension_combo)` pair. The sidebar now collapses these into one leaf per
  distinct `metric_name`; dimension refinement still happens inside the chart
  document's picker rail (#96).
* **Metric chart entry point moved to the sidebar** — Clicking a metric leaf
  in the connection sidebar (Metrics > Namespace > Metric) opens a chart
  pre-populated with defaults (Average statistic / 5 min period / aggregate
  across all dimensions) and immediately executes it. The picker rail opens
  alongside for refinement of dimensions, period, and statistic. Duplicate
  clicks on the same metric leaf focus the existing tab (#96).
* **Centralized `TimeRangePanel` custom-picker rendering** — A new
  `render_custom_picker_row` helper (and `CustomPickerSlots` for hosts that
  need per-slot decoration) is shared across `ChartDocument`, `CodeDocument`,
  the data-grid chart toolbar, and the audit document. The data-grid chart
  toolbar gains the custom date/hour/minute picker that previously was
  missing under "Custom…", and audit migrates off the last hand-rolled
  row. Behavior-preserving — public accessors and emitted events are
  unchanged (#121).
* **Chart toolbar wraps on narrow viewports** — The shared chart toolbar
  used by `ChartDocument` and `DataGridPanel` switched from a single
  non-wrapping flex row to the codebase's responsive pattern
  (`flex_wrap` + `gap_x/gap_y`, `min_h(34px)`). Trailing controls (TYPE
  chips, Stats / PNG / Save) no longer push off-screen when the document
  is narrow; rows grow downward instead of clipping (#136).
* **Stats rail gains an in-rail close affordance** — `ChartDocument`'s Stats
  rail now renders a header with a STATS title and an `×` close button so
  users can dismiss it without hunting for the toolbar toggle (#136).

### Removed

* `open_metrics_chart` workspace action and command-palette entry — the sidebar
  tree is now the single entry point for metric charts.
* `ChartDocument::new_empty_metric_chart` constructor — replaced by
  `new_with_source` with a pre-built `MetricSource` and `setup_metric_picker`.

### Fixed

* **Command palette keyboard navigation follows visual sections** — Filtered
  command-palette items now sort by rendered section order before match score,
  so Up/Down navigation moves through Connections, Commands, Charts, Tables,
  and Scripts exactly as displayed. Pressing Up from the first item in a
  section now lands on the previous visible section instead of jumping within
  the score-sorted backing list (#143).
* **Modal sizing & button overflow** — three confirm dialogs (Run entire
  script, Dangerous query, sidebar Delete/Drop) now use the shared
  `ModalShell` primitive with consistent widths and a dedicated footer
  button row. Buttons no longer overflow into the body, and the
  Drop Database / Delete confirms no longer render at half the size of
  the other confirm modals (#130).
* **Chart axis tick density on wide/tall plots** — Three targeted
  adjustments to the chart engine raise tick density without over-ticking
  small charts: `NICE_TIME_STEPS_MS` gains 2h / 3h / 12h / 2d / 3d entries
  (a 3-week range with 12 target ticks no longer collapses to 3 weekly
  ticks), the X-tick clamp floor drops from 4 to 3 so ~400px charts can
  render 3 ticks, and the Y-axis target switches from a build-time
  constant of 5 to a render-time `(plot_h / 60).clamp(3, 12)` that mirrors
  the existing X dynamic path (covers line / area / StackedBar / log).
  PR #123's dynamic edge-label padding is preserved (#132).
* **`ChartDocument` Stats rail toggle now actually renders** — The toggle
  state machine was complete but `render_chart_content` had no
  `ChartRailTab::Stats` branch, so clicking Stats appeared to do nothing.
  The rail now renders for query-result, saved-chart, and CloudWatch
  metric hosts with SERIES / STATS / WINDOW / SOURCE sections matching
  `DataGridPanel`. Closes #133 (#136).
* **MySQL editor diagnostics no longer flag DCL statements** — the MySQL
  driver was using the generic `SqlLanguageService` (tree-sitter-sequel
  / ANSI SQL), which chokes on `CREATE USER 'u'@'h' IDENTIFIED BY '…'`,
  `GRANT … TO 'u'@'h'`, `FLUSH PRIVILEGES`, etc., surfacing spurious
  "Unexpected …" errors. A new `MySqlLanguageService` (mirrors the
  MongoDB pattern) overrides `Connection::language_service()` to return
  empty editor diagnostics — the server stays the source of truth.
  MariaDB shares the impl and is covered automatically. Closes #126
  (#128).
* **`TimeRangePanel` window preserved against stale source-input
  clobber** — The result-panel chart toolbar's panel emitted
  `TimeRangeChanged` on every preset click, but `run_query_text` then
  unconditionally rebuilt `exec_ctx.source` from the once-populated
  `source_*_input` text fields, silently overwriting the panel's
  selection. A new `pending_window_override` on `CodeDocument` carries
  the authoritative panel bounds through a pure
  `resolve_source_context` helper that gives the override precedence
  over the input-driven fallback (and suppresses input validation
  errors when an override is present). `ChartDocument` was unaffected
  (no dual source of truth) (#124).
* **X-axis edge labels no longer clipped on charts** — the label paint
  loop centered labels on tick screen-X with no right-bound clamping,
  and the fixed `MARGIN_RIGHT = 16` did not reserve space for label
  overhang. A pre-shape pass in the paint closure now measures label
  widths and derives effective horizontal padding as
  `max(MARGIN_*, max_label_w / 2.0)` (base margins as a floor), with a
  symmetric left-edge guard. The Y-tick column tracks the effective
  left pad so it stays flush with the plot. Extracted as
  `effective_x_label_padding` with 6 unit tests (#120).
* **`ChartDocument` custom-range apply race** — `apply_custom_range`
  now sets `pending_time_window` and `pending_chart_reexecute`
  synchronously from the validated `(start_ms, end_ms)` returned by
  the panel, instead of waiting for the deferred `TimeRangeChanged`
  subscription. The subscription still fires for `selected_time_range`
  mirroring, but re-execution is no longer gated on its delivery
  timing (#121).
* **Connection + sidebar UX batch** — cancelling a connect task now
  also clears the profile-level pending-operation entry so the
  sidebar exits the "(connecting...)" state immediately. Editing a
  currently-connected profile surfaces a "Reconnect now / Later"
  toast; the edit always persists and the live session refreshes
  only on opt-in. Reopening Settings after closing it no longer
  wastes the first click (stale window handle cleared on close and
  on focus failure). Ctrl+click in the sidebar now seeds the
  keyboard-focused item into the multi-selection before toggling,
  matching the visual cursor (#145).
* **Row inspector follows the active tab and selection** — the
  workspace inspector rail used to be a singleton with no per-tab
  state, so switching tabs left a previous table's inspector
  rendered against the new tab's chrome. `DataGridPanel` now
  remembers `(row, col)` when the inspector opens and re-snapshots
  the row on tab activation, result refresh, and selection
  changes (click / arrow keys). Rows that fall out of bounds after
  a refresh close the rail cleanly. Explicit dismissal (× / ESC)
  drops the cached coords so the rail stays closed on return.
  Inspector column-name and value cells now share a flex layout
  (140px / 220px basis) with ellipsis truncation, so long names
  no longer wrap and resizing the rail redistributes width across
  both columns. `Ctrl+A` / `Cmd+A` inside an inline cell editor
  now selects the input text instead of all table rows (#145).

## [0.6.0-dev.8] - 2026-05-23

### Added

* **Audit event charts** — the Audit document now has a Table/Chart view
  toggle that visualizes the currently filtered audit events as counts
  over time, with one series per group value (grouped by category, outcome,
  or level). The chart honors the document's active time range and
  auto-refresh. Charts are ephemeral (a view mode, not a saved artifact).
* **Logarithmic Y axis for charts** — charts can switch the Y axis between
  linear and logarithmic (log1p) scale, so large spikes no longer flatten
  the rest of the data. Exposed in the audit chart toolbar.
* **CloudWatch metric charts** — CloudWatch connections can graph real
  metrics (via `GetMetricData`) as a time-series chart. An "Open Metrics
  Chart" command is available whenever the active driver advertises the
  generic metric-series capability; the chart refreshes over the active
  time window. The metric is currently fixed (AWS/Lambda Invocations,
  average over 5-minute periods); an in-app metric picker is a follow-up.
* **Generic `ChartDataSource` seam (W0)** — a driver-agnostic chart data
  trait that the audit and CloudWatch chart features both consume. The UI
  never branches on driver identity; charts are wired through metadata and
  capabilities.

### Changed

* **Charts respond to the active theme** — chart canvas chrome (gridlines,
  tick labels, crosshair, hover dot, readout overlays) and chart overlays
  (legend, axis bar, point inspector, picker) now route through a new
  `semantic::ChartColors` palette resolved per active theme. The Light
  theme no longer renders the dark series palette over a light canvas;
  Mirage and Dark use theme-driven series colors via the engine's
  `theme.chart_1..chart_5`. Dark series colors remain byte-identical to
  prior releases. Three deliberate Dark chrome divergences (gridlines via
  `theme.border`, tick labels via `theme.muted_foreground`, hover-dot
  background via `theme.background`) carry through and were validated by
  visual QA.
* **Document toolbar styling unified** — every document type's toolbar now
  uses the same shared primitives (icons, separators, spacing) so the look
  is consistent across SQL editors, chart documents, audit views, and the
  data grid.
* **UI split into six layered crates** — the monolithic `dbflux_ui` crate
  was split into `dbflux_components` (domain-free leaf), `dbflux_ui_base`
  (events/keymap/AppState seam), `dbflux_ui_document` (tabs, panes, all
  document types), `dbflux_ui_windows` (settings + connection manager),
  `dbflux_ui_sidebar`, and a thin `dbflux_ui` integrator. Per-driver
  feature flags no longer live on UI crates (they belong to `dbflux_app`,
  which registers drivers). Incremental rebuilds are noticeably faster.
* **Design tokens consolidated across every UI crate** — every UI crate
  now consumes the centralized `dbflux_components::tokens` scale
  (`Spacing`, `Borders`, `Widths`, `ChartGeometry`) and routes banner
  colors through a single `semantic::BannerColors`. Each crate is locked
  by a source-scanning guardrail test that prevents regressions. Chart
  factory files (`axis_bar`, `point_inspector`, `legend`) sit under the
  guardrail; only `chart/engine.rs` stays exempt for canvas geometry math.
  Behavior-preserving.
* **`dbflux` binary dependency cleanup** — the binary's `Cargo.toml` no
  longer declares the driver/runtime crates as direct optional deps; they
  are activated through `dbflux_app/<feature>`. Feature relays unchanged
  from a user perspective; `--features sqlite,…,lua,aws,mcp` continues to
  work identically.

### Fixed

* **Audit row detail expanded full-width with custom range inputs
  visible** — the Audit document's row detail panel now spans the full
  width of the document and the custom date-range inputs are no longer
  clipped behind toolbar chrome.
* **Audit SQLite "database is locked" errors under contention** — the
  audit store now sets a 5s `busy_timeout` when opening its connection.
  Since the audit database shares a WAL file with `StorageRuntime` (and
  tests may race on a shared temp path), concurrent openers previously
  failed immediately with `SQLITE_BUSY` instead of waiting; they now
  serialize. Fixes intermittent test failures in the MCP governance
  suite.

## [0.6.0-dev.7] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

* **Focus shortcuts on macOS/Windows** — `Ctrl+Shift+1..4` (Focus
  Sidebar / Editor / Results / Tasks) now fire on every platform. GPUI
  normalizes `Shift`+digit chords at the platform layer (e.g. macOS
  delivers `Ctrl+Shift+2` as `@` with `shift=false`), so the literal
  `KeymapStack` matchers never matched the runtime keystroke. The four
  shortcuts are now registered as native GPUI key bindings, which GPUI
  normalizes per platform/layout at registration time. The `KeymapStack`
  entries are retained solely as the command-palette shortcut-label
  source.
* **DriverCapabilities bit collision** — `MULTI_STATEMENT` and `ROUTINES`
  were both defined as `1 << 47` in the same bitflags, so a driver
  advertising one silently advertised the other. `MULTI_STATEMENT` now
  occupies bit 48, with a regression test asserting the bits are
  distinct.
* **DynamoDB upsert capability** — `MutationCapabilities.supports_upsert`
  was `false` even though the driver implements single-item upsert
  (`PutItem`) and only rejects `many + upsert`. The flag is now `true`,
  so the MCP write tool no longer rejects a supported operation.

## [0.6.0-dev.6] - 2026-05-20

### Added

* **Multi-statement script execution** — running a buffer with no active
  selection now offers to execute the whole script (multiple
  `;`-separated statements) behind a "Run entire script (N statements)?"
  confirmation, on drivers that advertise the new
  `DriverCapabilities::MULTI_STATEMENT` flag. `QueryLanguage` splits
  SQL-family buffers while skipping separators inside strings,
  identifiers, line/block comments, and PostgreSQL dollar-quoted bodies;
  non-SQL languages stay single-statement. PostgreSQL routes batches
  through the simple query protocol (batched columns are untyped text);
  MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite split client-side and run each statement
  through the typed prepared path (also fixing SQLite silently executing
  only the first statement); MSSQL already executed batches natively.
  Each result set renders in its own result tab. The seam is
  driver-agnostic — the UI gates on the capability flag, never on driver
  identity.
* **Stored Procedures / Routines folder** — a capability-gated Routines
  folder now appears under schema nodes in the sidebar, gated on the new
  `DriverCapabilities::ROUTINES` flag (never on driver id). Core exposes
  `RoutineInfo` / `RoutineKind` keyed on the engine-provided
  `specific_name` for overload-safe node identity, plus
  `Connection::schema_routines` / `routine_definition` with default
  empty implementations so non-supporting drivers fall back gracefully.
  PostgreSQL (via `pg_proc`/`pg_get_functiondef` with an aggregate/window
  fallback), MySQL/MariaDB (via `information_schema.ROUTINES` +
  `SHOW CREATE`), and SQL Server (via `sys.objects` +
  `OBJECT_DEFINITION`) implement listing. Clicking a routine opens a
  read-only `CodeDocument` (editor disabled, completion off, mutating and
  execution toolbar buttons hidden) that round-trips across session
  restore.

### Changed

* **Workspace document architecture refactor** — the closed
  `DocumentHandle` enum that previously gated every document type was
  replaced with a `PaneHandle` closure-erasing shell. Adding a new
  document type now requires only a new `<name>/pane.rs` and one
  `open_<name>` function in `workspace/actions.rs`; no changes to
  `workspace/mod.rs`, `tab_manager.rs`, `tab_bar.rs`, or `handle.rs`.
  Introduces `DocumentKey` for tab deduplication (replaces the six
  `is_*` methods), a unified `DocumentEvent` (replaces four per-document
  event enums), and a universal `ResultPanel` + `ViewHandle` chrome host
  with a `ToolbarSegment` slot system (`Left | Center | Right` +
  `index`, `flex_wrap` row) for filter bars, axis bars, range chips,
  and similar view-provided controls. `handle.rs` reduced from 486 to
  29 LOC; `audit/mod.rs` reduced from 3454 to 1628 LOC. No new
  dependencies, no functional regressions, 2169 tests pass.
* **Chart-specific icons across chart surfaces and the result mode bar**
  — added `ChartSpline`/`ChartArea`/`ChartColumnBig`/`ChartBar`/
  `ChartPie`/`ChartNetwork` icons (with a `for_chart_kind` helper) and
  replaced generic placeholders: the chart tab and the "Chart this
  query" menu/editor button now use `ChartSpline`, the chart toolbar
  Stats button uses `ChartBar`, and the Data | Chart | JSON result-view
  mode bar gains per-mode icons.

### Fixed

* **Result mode bar appears in CodeDocument query results** —
  `DataGridPanel::available_result_view_modes` no longer gates on the
  currently active mode, so the Data | Chart | JSON bar now renders the
  moment a `QueryResult` arrives (instead of only after the user
  manually switched away from Table). Regression introduced earlier in
  the workspace-view refactor.

## [0.6.0-dev.5] - 2026-05-20

### Added

* **Microsoft SQL Server driver** — first-class SQL Server support
  built on `tiberius`, with TLS modes (`off`, `on`, `required` +
  `trust_server_certificate`), SSH tunnel and SQL Browser named-
  instance routing, full multi-schema introspection (`hr`, `sales`,
  `dbo`, …), CRUD via `OUTPUT INSERTED.*` / `OUTPUT DELETED.*`,
  `OFFSET ... FETCH NEXT` paging, and cooperative query cancellation
  via side-channel `KILL <spid>` with automatic session restore and
  active-database recovery. `ColumnKind` is wired across every
  `tiberius::ColumnType` so MSSQL results integrate with chart
  auto-detection.

### Fixed

* **Long text wraps in toasts, banners, and the delete-confirmation
  modal** — long error strings and titles previously overflowed past
  the card edge instead of wrapping. The flex chain inside the card
  is now configured so titles and subtitles wrap within the
  container's `max_w`.
* **Delete-confirmation popup no longer duplicates the dedicated
  delete modals** — when `ModalDeleteConnection` or
  `ModalDropTable` is open, the generic confirmation popup is now
  suppressed so users don't see two overlapping delete dialogs.
* **Connection profile add / remove / update now persist on disk** —
  removing a profile failed to delete its row because `save_profiles`
  was upsert-only, and add / update relied on an MCP-side persist
  hook so changes were lost on builds without MCP. `app_state` now
  calls the storage repository directly on every mutation.

## [0.6.0-dev.4] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

* **Data grid column header prioritizes the column name** — the name,
  PK/FK badges, and type chip were equal-weight siblings, so long type
  labels (e.g. MySQL's raw `MYSQL_TYPE_VAR_STRING`) pushed the column
  name out of view. The name is now the primary affordance rendered with
  the standard foreground and never ellipsized, while the type label and
  PK/FK badges share a single muted styling and shrink first. MySQL now
  maps protocol types to canonical SQL labels (`VARCHAR`, `BIGINT
  UNSIGNED`, `DECIMAL(p,s)`, …) and DynamoDB infers a label from the
  first sampled item instead of showing the literal `"DynamoDB"`.
* **Pending inserts are committed on save** — `request_save_all` emitted
  virtual row indices for pending inserts while the commit path looked
  them up by array index, so on any table with existing rows the save
  aborted silently with no error. Inserts now persist regardless of the
  base row count.
* **Chart engine plots Decimal and Bool columns** — `extract_f64` only
  handled `Value::Int`, `Value::Float`, and timestamp-typed `Value::Text`,
  silently dropping `Value::Decimal` and `Value::Bool`. Columns whose
  `ColumnKind` is numeric (e.g. PostgreSQL `NUMERIC`, MSSQL `DECIMAL`,
  MSSQL `BIT`) now render correctly instead of producing an empty series
  with no error.
* **PostgreSQL array columns accept inserts and updates** — saving a row
  into a `text[]` / `int4[]` / etc. column failed with `expression is of
  type jsonb` because the dialect emitted `'<json>'::jsonb` regardless of
  the destination type. Per-column type metadata now flows from the UI
  data grid and MCP write tools through `RowInsert`/`RowPatch`/
  `SqlUpdateRequest`/`SqlUpsertRequest` to the dialect, which emits
  `ARRAY[...]::elem[]` for array columns and keeps `::jsonb` for JSON
  columns. The IPC wire format stays backward compatible via serde
  shims, so older driver peers keep working.

## [0.6.0-dev.3] - 2026-05-16

### Added

* **Chart engine** — first-class time-series charts across the
  workspace. Results in the data grid gain a Chart mode with an axis
  bindings bar (X / Y / Group By / Aggregate), a shared toolbar
  (range, refresh, window, points, stats, PNG, save), LTTB
  decimation, axis tick labels, a user-toggleable legend, and a
  crosshair readout with nearest-sample lookup. Charts can be saved
  and reopened from the command palette.
* **`ChartDocument`** — standalone chart document opened via "Chart
  this query" from a data grid context menu. Owns its own time-range
  panel, refresh dropdown and execution loop; the query is fixed for
  the document's lifetime.
* **`ColumnKind` metadata** — every driver now reports per-column
  semantic kind (Timestamp, Numeric, Tag, etc.) used by chart
  detection. Wired across Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis,
  DynamoDB, CloudWatch, OpenSearch, Cypher, and InfluxDB.
* **InfluxDB driver** — InfluxDB v1 (InfluxQL) and v2 (Flux) support
  with full query, chart, and metadata integration.

### Changed

* **Branding** — adopted the new DBFlux mark from the design system
  across the application chrome.

## [0.6.0-dev.2] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

* **SQL editor diagnostics no longer flag PostgreSQL dollar-quoted
  blocks** — valid `DO $$ ... $$;` anonymous code blocks and other
  `$tag$`-quoted bodies were marked with spurious syntax errors because
  the bundled tree-sitter SQL grammar does not understand dollar
  quoting or PL/pgSQL. Parse diagnostics are now skipped when the query
  contains a closed dollar-quoted block.

## [0.6.0-dev.1] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

* **Platform-aware keybindings** — application-level shortcuts now use
  Cmd on macOS and Ctrl on Linux/Windows: command palette
  (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`), new/close/switch tab, run query, save, open
  script/history, export results, toggle sidebar, audit viewer, and
  Results cell copy. vim-style navigation (`Ctrl+h/j/k/l`, `Ctrl+u/d`)
  and `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` stay literal Ctrl on every platform,
  along with focus shortcuts (`Ctrl+Shift+1..4`) that would clash with
  macOS screenshot bindings and `Ctrl+M` which would clash with
  window-minimize on macOS. Inline data-table commands (Copy, Save row,
  Select all, Undo/Redo) use GPUI's `secondary-` modifier so they pick
  the right key per platform. Command-palette shortcut labels and the
  SQL editor / save-row hints now reflect the platform modifier. Closes
  #63.

## [0.6.0-dev.0] - 2026-05-12

### Features

* **Workspace-level inspector rail** — row inspector promoted to a
  workspace-wide rail and migrated off the per-document overlay (#52).
* **Nix prebuilt-binary package** — `pkgs.dbflux` is now a prebuilt
  binary fetched from the matching GitHub Release (pinned by
  `nix/release-info.nix` and built via `nix/binary.nix`), with a
  fallback `pkgs.dbflux-source` for compiling locally. The flake also
  exposes `overlays.default` so downstream flakes can consume the
  package directly.

### Chores

* Adopt trunk + short-lived release-branch model: add `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  label-aware PR/issue templates, and `docs/RELEASE.md` documenting the
  cut and tag procedures.
* Release workflow publishes stable tags (`vX.Y.Z`) directly and marks
  `-dev.N` / `-rc.N` tags as prereleases.
* Cherry-pick discipline now requires removing the corresponding entry
  from main's `[Unreleased]` block after the picked commit lands on the
  release branch, and the cut procedure verifies the release workflow
  has the `Classify release` step before tagging.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-05-13

### Fixes

* Toast bubble no longer overflows the screen when the subtitle is long.
  The title and subtitle now stack vertically inside a `flex_1 min_w_0`
  column so the subtitle wraps within the card's `max_w` (raised from
  26rem to 28rem) instead of pushing the whole toast past the workspace
  edge. The card also calls `.occlude()` so clicks on its empty area no
  longer fall through to the sidebar or document underneath.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-05-13

### Fixes

* Schema-drift preflight no longer reports phantom "all columns removed"
  for queries whose table lives outside `public`. The fresh fetch is now
  steered to the right schema via a layered precedence (query qualifier
  → cached `TableInfo.schema` → editor toolbar's schema → `public`
  fallback), and the checker defensively skips any entry whose driver
  lookup returns zero columns — preventing the empty `TableInfo` from
  poisoning the autocomplete and table-detail caches via the
  "Refresh & re-run" path.

### Chores

* Pin EOL to LF via `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) so
  `cargo fmt` no longer desyncs Windows working trees that default to
  `core.autocrlf=true`.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-05-13

### Fixes

* Results table horizontal trackpad / wheel scroll now respects the
  platform sign convention (macOS "natural scrolling" preference,
  Linux / Windows scroll direction) and the body shifts on the same
  frame as the scrollbar, removing the one-frame lag that read as
  jitter during trackpad momentum. Follow-up to #60.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-05-13

### Features

* Ctrl+C / Cmd+C now copies the selected cell (or range) from the Results
  grid to the clipboard, matching the right-click → Copy behavior.

### Fixes

* Results table now scrolls horizontally with trackpad / Magic Mouse
  gestures and `Shift+Wheel`. The horizontal scroll handle is owned by
  a 1px phantom scroller so the scrollbar widget can drive it, which
  meant horizontal wheel deltas landing on the header or body were
  dropped; the table now forwards those deltas to the handle, and the
  vertical-only uniform list is restricted to its axis so GPUI's
  built-in delta.x → delta.y fallback no longer double-scrolls on
  shift+wheel (#58).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-13

### Fixes

* Results data grid shows the horizontal scrollbar immediately when
  the columns are wider than the viewport. gpui-component scrollbars
  render fully transparent at idle and only fade in after a scroll
  event; the horizontal axis is driven by a 1px phantom scroller that
  never receives the wheel, so previously the bar stayed invisible
  until the user arrowed past the right edge. The horizontal scrollbar
  is now configured with `ScrollbarShow::Always`.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-12

### Features

* Logger now initialises at the very start of `run_gui()` so startup
  diagnostics (IPC socket binding, auth token init) reach the log sink.
  Setting `DBFLUX_LOG_FILE` redirects all `log::*!` output to the given
  file in append mode — useful on Windows where the GUI subsystem hides
  stderr.

### Fixes

* SQL editor keeps focus after dismissing the completion popup with Esc.
  gpui-component's `CompletionMenu::hide` clears the menu but the
  follow-up re-render drops `window.focus` even though the input still
  owned it synchronously; the editor pane now re-focuses its input on
  the next tick so typing keeps working.

## [0.5.0] – 2026-05-11

### Features

* **Design system foundation** — new `dbflux_components` crate with a complete
  design-system token scale (`AppStyle` Compact / Default density tiers,
  semantic color tokens, density accessors threaded through `Button`,
  `Dropdown`, `PanelHeader`, `Surface`, `Badge`, `FocusFrame`, `Text` and the
  whole typography stack). The Style is persisted in `general_settings` and
  selectable from a new Style dropdown in General settings. Ayu Mirage joined
  Ayu Dark as a first-class theme.
* **Hi-Fi design bundle applied across the app** — workspace chrome refresh
  (Linux CSD titlebar with breadcrumb, doc-tab dirty dot, pulsing status bar),
  sidebar (compact tab strip, magnifier-prefix search, no double border,
  `StatusDot` per row, single compact footer with connected/idle count),
  data grid with column PK/FK badges and row-state colors, paginator
  `‹ N / Total ›`, schema-drift detection with modal, command palette
  redesign (grouped sections, `Chord` shortcuts, deep-Ayu-Dark background),
  settings navigation (uppercase XS group headers, `warning_bg`-tinted active
  item, keybinding rows with `Chord` + conflict banner), audit document
  6-column grid with `BannerColors` LVL chips, empty workspace state with
  shortcut chords.
* **New shared primitives** — `StatusDot`, `BannerBlock`, `TypeToConfirm`,
  `Chord`, `KbdBadge`, `SegmentedControl`, `FilePicker`, `Logs` icon,
  `RowColors`/`BannerColors`/`StatusDotPalette` token families, `Anim` and
  `Widths`/`Shadows` constants.
* **Rich Toast system** — explicit `Toast::xxx(title).subtitle(...).body(...)`
  `.details(...).code_block(...).progress(...).action(...).collapsible()`
  `.push(cx)` builder with auto-dismiss policy per variant, action buttons,
  collapsible details, and a 4 px left accent stripe. All ~100 call sites
  migrated to the explicit builder; the old `cx.toast_xxx(msg, window)`
  trait removed. SQL execution errors render rich with `FormattedError`
  (subtitle = SQLSTATE, body = message, code_block = HINT, "Copy" action).
* **Row Inspector overlay** — 320 px floating panel with PK/FK indicators,
  FK forward-resolution (issued against the per-database connection so it
  works on Postgres' connection-per-database model), inline wrapping for
  long FK headers and resolution errors, drag-mask resize (240 – 1280 px),
  scroll containment, and a working `×` close button.
* **Connection manager rebuild** — driver picker as a grouped, alphabetical
  4-col card grid with `/`-focusable filter input and 2D keyboard
  navigation; per-driver SSL modes via `SegmentedControl` declared by each
  driver's metadata; cert paths chosen via `FilePicker`; SSH passphrase
  prompt with 60 min in-memory remember; enriched test-connection
  `BannerBlock` (engine version, RTT, server time, SSL ciphersuite).
* **Driver metadata expansion** — new `DatabaseCategory::LogStream` (with
  CloudWatch reclassified to it and using the new `Logs` icon),
  `DeploymentClass` enum (Self-hosted / Embedded / Cloud-managed) surfaced
  in Settings → Drivers, per-driver `SslModeOption` lists and
  `SslCertFields` capability. MongoDB and Redis gained TLS support
  (`CombinedPemFile` helper concatenates cert+key for MongoDB).
* **Schema-aware features** — `SchemaCache::dependents` cache, per-driver
  `fetch_dependents`, `referenced_tables`, `fetch_row_by_pk`,
  `test_connection_rich` on `Connection`; `SchemaFingerprint` for drift
  detection.
* **Built-in CloudWatch Logs integration** (#43).
* **External RPC auth providers reach AWS parity** — runtime registration
  over RPC, login-capable providers with device-URL flow surfaced in the
  shared login modal, opaque `AuthSessionDto.session_data` round-trip, and
  generic `DynamicSelect` form fields whose options are fetched through the
  new `FetchFieldOptions` IPC method. Auth-provider IPC reaches v1.2 with a
  `secret_dependency_opt_in` manifest flag; `Password`-typed values are
  stripped from option requests by default. AWS SSO Account ID / Role Name
  dropdowns now travel through the generic path — no provider id is
  hard-coded in the Settings panel anymore. The Provider selector is a
  single dropdown over the full registry (built-in + RPC-discovered).
* **Sidebar batch delete** — multi-select rows and delete them in one action.
* **RPC services foundation** — formalised driver and auth-provider service
  kinds, shared bootstrap, and negotiated API-version contracts at startup.

### Fixes

* `FetchOptionsError::SessionExpired` and `NeedsLogin` now surface a visible
  per-field re-login hint and provider-level banner instead of being
  silently logged.
* `RefreshTrigger::Manual` only fetches on cache miss — no more refetch on
  every render.
* MySQL connection configs are preserved across reloads.
* The data grid keeps CRUD actions available on empty tables.
* `nix develop` is back to a working state.
* Sidebar tree survives degraded storage loads and no longer overwrites a
  broken connection tree.
* PostgreSQL `GRANT` statements no longer surface false-positive
  diagnostics in the editor.
* Editor focus is preserved after running a query.

### Chores

* CI now runs DynamoDB live integration tests.
* Workspace-wide rustc/clippy lints (warn level) opted into by all driver
  crates; `rustfmt.toml` baseline added.
* Repo-specific workflow skills added for contributor automation.

---

## [0.4.0] – 2026-04-05

### Architecture

* Codebase split into `dbflux_app` (pure domain, no GPUI) and `dbflux_ui` (all GPUI/UI code); `dbflux` binary is now a thin shell
* `AppState` extracted as a plain struct in `dbflux_app`; `AppStateEntity` wrapper with GPUI event emission lives in `dbflux_ui`
* `dbflux_core` reorganized from 50 flat files into 10 thematic subdirectories (`core/`, `driver/`, `schema/`, `sql/`, `query/`, `connection/`, `storage/`, `data/`, `config/`, `facade/`)

* Value sources for managed access fields: SSM Parameter Store, Secrets Manager, environment variables
* SSO auth profiles write back to `~/.aws/config` for compatibility with other AWS tools
* DynamoDB driver uses same managed access pipeline for seamless AWS integration

---

## [0.3.7] – 2026-03-06

### Added

* Dedicated style CI workflow that runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`

### Changed

* New connections and SSH tunnels now save credentials to the system keyring by default unless the checkbox is explicitly disabled
* Release workflow now blocks artifact builds until both tests and style checks pass

### Fixed

* SQL query context selectors now refresh when connections and databases change, so tabs opened before connecting can pick their execution target correctly
* Per-database query task cancellation now cleans up the exact connection target, allowing the sidebar to reopen those databases after cancellation
* PostgreSQL connection retry setup and live integration tests now compile cleanly under current type inference requirements
* Restored the full `LICENSE-MIT` text in release artifacts

---

## [0.3.6] – 2026-02-28

### Added

* Comprehensive live integration tests for all five database drivers (43 tests covering schema introspection, CRUD, browse/count, explain, describe, cancellation, code generators, document CRUD, and KeyValueApi)
* Docker-based test infrastructure for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis with automatic container lifecycle management
* Driver contract validation tests for metadata, form definitions, and capability declarations

### Changed

* AppState now accepts an external driver registry, making driver wiring controllable across different runtime contexts
* Document open and query connection selection extracted into explicit decision paths for consistent handling of missing connections and per-database routing
* MySQL `information_schema` queries migrated from `format!()` string interpolation to parameterized queries (`conn.exec` with `?` placeholders)
* MySQL nullable column reads (`Option<String>`) now use `row.get_opt()` to correctly distinguish SQL NULL from missing columns

### Fixed

* MySQL schema introspection panic on MySQL 8.4 where `column_key` in `information_schema.columns` can be NULL
* MySQL constraint introspection panic where `GROUP_CONCAT` over a `LEFT JOIN` returns NULL for CHECK constraints without key columns
* Windows portable builds no longer open a CMD console window when launched outside a terminal
* CI integration test job now installs required system dependencies (`libdbus-1-dev`, `libxkbcommon-dev`)

## [0.3.5] – 2026-02-26

### Added

* Explicit unsupported-value representation in query results (`UNSUPPORTED<type>`) to distinguish decode gaps from real `NULL` values

### Changed

* Unsupported values are now treated as read-only in the data grid and are excluded from save/copy mutation flows

### Fixed

* Added complete PostgreSQL `tsvector`/`tsquery` handling across table browse, query results, and grid filtering
* PostgreSQL fallback decode paths no longer misrepresent unknown types as `NULL`, reducing confusion and avoiding incorrect edits

---

## [0.3.4] – 2026-02-26

### Added

* Inline enum/set dropdown editing in the data grid with keyboard navigation (`j/k`, arrows, `Enter`, `Esc`)
* Nullable enum editing support with explicit `NULL` option in dropdowns
* Driver-level enum value metadata (`enum_values`) in `ColumnInfo` for PostgreSQL and MySQL
* Info-level logging for unsupported value decoding paths in PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite drivers

### Changed

* PostgreSQL column introspection now uses `pg_catalog` + `format_type(...)` to preserve real type names (including user-defined types)
* PostgreSQL generated SQL literals now use escaped single-quoted string literals for readability
* MySQL `ENUM(...)` and `SET(...)` column definitions are parsed and exposed as selectable values in the UI

### Fixed

* PostgreSQL custom types (enum/domain/composite/range) no longer appear as `NULL` due to restrictive string decoding
* Table mode command routing now handles `Execute`/`Cancel` correctly, restoring keyboard-driven inline editing flow
* `LIKE` filter generation now only adds `ESCAPE '\\'` when required by the search value
* PostgreSQL `uuid` columns now cast to `::text` for `LIKE` filters

---

### Changed

* Sidebar schema folders now stay visible with zero counts while lazy details load
* SQL and MongoDB schema folders are collapsed by default to avoid layout jumps during refresh

### Fixed

* Sidebar expansion no longer gets stuck in a loading state when opening schema nodes
* Closing a database connection no longer blocks the UI thread and freezes the app

---

## [0.3.2] – 2026-02-24

### Added

* Order submenu in data grid context menu for SQL databases (ASC, DESC, Remove order)
* MongoDB filter submenu in document tree context menu with Extended JSON values, `$and` composition, and NULL semantics (`$exists` guard)
* ListFilter and ArrowUpDown icons
* Empty state for the sidebar connections tab ("No connections yet" hint)

### Changed

* CI release workflow extracts changelog section from CHANGELOG.md instead of using hardcoded text

### Fixed

* GPUI newline panic: escape control characters in `Value::Json` preview in document tree
* GPUI newline panic: escape control characters in `Value::Text` and catch-all rendering in document card view
* GPUI newline panic: use compact JSON (no newlines) when composing MongoDB filters for the single-line filter input
* Toolbar clear-filter button now re-runs the query after clearing (was only calling `cx.notify()` without `refresh()`)
* Refactored icon asset loading to use `ALL_ICONS` lookup table instead of match arms

---

## [0.3.1] – 2026-02-24

### Fixed

* Table expansion in sidebar now loads and displays columns, indexes, and foreign keys instead of showing a stuck "Loading..." placeholder
* Concurrent table expansions no longer overwrite each other (replaced single pending action slot with per-item map)
* Failed schema fetches now collapse the table node instead of leaving it stuck in loading state
* Cache key mismatch between tree builder and fetch path that prevented details from ever appearing for per-database connections

### Added

* Collapsed sidebar now shows separate buttons for Connections and Scripts tabs
* FileCode icon registered in asset source

---

## [0.3.0] – 2026-02-23

#### Query Generation

* Unified query generation with "Copy as Query" and preview modal
* `QueryGenerator` trait implemented by PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Redis drivers
* `SqlDialect` trait for SQL flavor differences across drivers

#### Export

* Multi-format export: CSV, JSON, Text, and Binary
* Export generalized by result shape instead of hardcoded CSV

#### Auto-Refresh

* Interval-based auto-refresh with unified refresh split button
* `DocumentTaskRunner` for unified async task tracking

### Changed

* `CellValue` pre-computes display text at construction time (avoids allocation during render)
* Lazy loading for PostgreSQL and SQLite drivers (shallow metadata first, details on demand)
* Sidebar uses `SchemaNodeId` parsing instead of stale underscore prefixes
* Custom toast implementation replaces `gpui-component` toast
* AppState decomposed into focused sub-managers in `dbflux_core`

### Performance

* Fixed catastrophic 1 FPS rendering issue in the data table
* Row-level event handlers replace per-cell closures in tables
* Background executor used consistently for all database operations

### Fixed

* Document focus restored across menus and modals
* Redis database state handling and UI interaction bugs
* SSH tunnel form mouse focus syncs with keyboard state
* Settings sync between SSH form fields
* Panics and unwraps eliminated across UI and driver code
* Empty query results now return column metadata correctly
* DDL queries show preview modal and editor height is correct
* Sidebar "New File"/"New Folder" creates inside the selected folder instead of at root
* Reveal in File Manager works on macOS and Windows (not just Linux)
* Opening an already-open script activates its tab instead of closing it
